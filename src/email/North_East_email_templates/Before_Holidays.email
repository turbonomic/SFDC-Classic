Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I'm sure you are busy trying to finish things up before the holidays. I have been trying to contact you to discuss how a virtualization control system could benefit your organization. 

Could we schedule a few minutes for after the Holidays? If I don't hear from you, I will give you a ring in January.

Best,

Brady
