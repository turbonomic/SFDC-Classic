Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

If VMTurbo has caught your interest, the entire evaluation process—Demo, Install, Customize, Evaluate—takes less than 3 hours, and can be done on your team’s schedule; only engaging our sales team if you choose to do so. 

The virtual appliance takes 5 minutes to download from http://www.vmturbo.com/product/editions-pricing/free-trial/ and within 30 minutes VMTurbo will begin providing recommendations for optimizing your virtual environment. 

For 30 days you can see the full value of the product—on your time, with no commitment—and if at any point you decide you do want to work with one of our engineers, we’ll be here!

Thanks,
