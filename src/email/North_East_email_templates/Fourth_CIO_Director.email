Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I have been trying to contact you in regard to virtualization management. 

I understand that you are likely not the evaluator of new management software and was hoping that you could point me in the right direction. 

When speaking with the appropriate people, the value our software has on IT departments' bottom lines is easily recognizable. I do not wish to waste any of your or my organizationsâ€™ time reaching out to uninvolved parties. 

Thanks,

Brady
