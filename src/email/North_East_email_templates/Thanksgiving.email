Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

With the new year approaching quickly, I was hoping to connect and understand your 2013 priorities around virtualization and cloud.

In 2012 VMTurbo helped hundreds of companies embrace preventative management and even automate maintenance of virtual environments.

Enjoy your holiday, and I will reach back out next week to discuss further.

Thanks,

Brady
