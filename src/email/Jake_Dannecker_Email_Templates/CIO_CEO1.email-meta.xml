    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well.


Two of the founders of VMTurbo (Shmuel Kliger and Yuri Rabover) would like to know if you would be interested in a philosophical conversation regarding the “Holistic View” management of the DC.  They have a similar, if not mirrored view and were interested in how you formed your theories and a general conversation regarding virtualization.  If you are open to this, please let me know a few times that would work and I will connect you with Shmuel and Yuri.


Regards,



Jacob
