Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
 
 When the London School of Economics (LSE) sought a solution to make efficiency improvements in its virtualized data center without compromising service levels of virtualized applications—and without overburdening its lean IT operations team—it chose 
technology from VMTurbo. Read this brief success story &lt;http://bit.ly/Uhatqm&gt; to understand how VMTurbo Operations Manager ensures applications have the physical and virtual IT resources needed, drives the highest utilization of infrastructure 
resources, and projects the impact of new workloads and growth on the environment—reducing operational overhead in LSE’s expanding virtualized data center. 

As an IT leader for your educational institution, you may be facing similar pressures as you expand virtualized servers in your environment and realize that hypervisor-specific management tools alone can’t meet your requirements. Surely, with initiatives for virtual desktop infrastructure, student and faculty portals, and electronic learning, you have a lot to manage.  That’s why maximizing the efficiency of resources—IT assets and operational staff—to control costs is at the top of your To-Do list. 

VMTurbo Operations Manager &lt;http://bit.ly/SY81or&gt; can help you prevent application performance degradation and resource bottlenecks, improve utilization, and intelligently plan for growth, as well as 
increase the efficiency of your operational staff. Learn more about LSE’s success story &lt;http://bit.ly/Uhatqm&gt; , and see how your organization could benefit from the use of VMTurbo’s technology.
