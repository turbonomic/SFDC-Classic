Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Do you need to deliver better services faster via rapid, iterative application development? Containers and microservices make it possible, but compared to a virtualized IT environment, a containerized 
environment is highly dynamic with greater density and more layers to manage.

While the artifacts have changed the challenges are the same – just more complex. How do you ensure workloads get the resources they need when they need them?
 
Please let us know &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-demo-container-platforms/]]&gt; if you would like to learn more about how we can help your organization.
 

Cheers,
