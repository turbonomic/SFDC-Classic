    <subject>Minimize Downtime like Aetna... (1493656204.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Jason-  I cover Tennessee Healthcare here at Turbonomic. I’m reaching out to see if you would be open to a conversation about how Turbonomic’s technology can help address some of the problems specific to healthcare IT professionals and stated goals of yours. We work with several organizations here in the state, including : Baptist Memorial, Dialysis Clinic, Covenanant Health, ALSAC, and more....  and have proven to help these organizations &quot; minimize downtime and deliver expectional results..&quot;  With greater pressure than ever before to implement EHR/EMR and demonstrate meaningful use, the healthcare IT landscape is becoming more complex each day. Combined with the mission critical nature of healthcare applications, strict industry regulations, and looming cost implications, the task of executing on your cloud and virtualization strategy isn’t easy. I’d love to spend some time sharing with you how we’re helping organizations like Mary Washington Healthcare and TeamHealth overcome the challenge of assuring application performance while maximizing efficiency in their virtual infrastructures. Below is a figure displaying the results we have driven across all our current healthcare customers.  Would you be open to a conversation Friday 11 am or 1 pm ? If you&apos;d like to learn more, take a look at our Turbonomic for Healthcare Providers solution brief &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_Data-Sheet_Healthcare.pdf]]&gt;, which explains the value we can add in more detail.
