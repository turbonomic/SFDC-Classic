    <subject>VMworld 2013: Try VMTurbo Fast and Free</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

It’s been some time since VMworld 2013 in San Francisco and we’re now looking ahead to the Online VMware Forum on October 22nd. Whether or not you plan to attend the event, you are likely in the throes of preparing for 2014, and you’re most definitely pressed for time as you do so. 

To that end, we’ll skip the long pitch and take you directly to the offer of a free trial &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; of Operations Manager, which you can download quickly and see value immediately. Find out first-hand why over 80% of our customers have been able to increase resource utilization by more than 20%, while almost two thirds saw this value within 15 business days.

Best Regards,

VMTurbo Team
Headed to VMware Online Forum &lt;http://bit.ly/16kJYVR&gt;? Stop by our virtual booth and chat with us.</textOnly>
