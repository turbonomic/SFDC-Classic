    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We’d like to cordially invite you to an exclusive networking event in Reston on June 14th at McCormick &amp; Schmick’s. 
 
Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reimagine their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging – and mistakes are costly.
