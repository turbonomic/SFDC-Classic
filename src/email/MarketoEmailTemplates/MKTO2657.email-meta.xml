After a long day of work wouldn&apos;t it be nice to automate the process of cooking and cleaning up from dinner? While we here at Turbonomic can automate a lot of actions, dinner is not one of them. That being said, we can offer you the next best thing.  Come join EchoStor and Turbonomic &lt;[[https://echostor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Turbo_Dine-n_Dash_Event_Email.html]]&gt; at Maggiano&apos;s for drinks and appetizersÂ as we discuss how to deliver better applications faster regardless of cloud, infrastructure or architecture. After our brief session we will send you home with a dinner for four from one of the best Italian restaurants in all of Boston!

	- When: Wednesday June, 7th 2017, 7PM
