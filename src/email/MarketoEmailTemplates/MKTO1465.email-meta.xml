Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

As workloads proliferate and IT scales to meet the demands of business, organizations must increase focus on maintaining software licensing compliance, or else pay unexpected (and often unaffordable) vendor penalties.

Our survey aims to uncover the communal experience of vendors&apos; licensing structures, and how organizations like yours are fighting back.

All respondents will be entered to win a TurboStack Home Lab, complete with native OpenStack Juno, valued at over $1,600!

Please take this short survey for a chance to win a TurboStack Home Lab!
