Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Operations Manager 5.2 is now available! We also released an upgrade to Operations Manager 5.1 – update 3. As a current user of VMTurbo you should update to 5.1 update 3 and if you want to learn more about 5.2 and all it has to offer join our webinar on May 21st at 11:30 AM EST &lt;http://vmturbo.com/data-center-control?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=5-2-webinar&amp;utm_content=05132015&gt;.


 - Defining QoS levels for specific applications


You can specify, for example 500 ms latency or 1,000 transactions per minute, for a specific application. As VMTurbo brokers resources in the data center it prioritizes those applications to assure commitments are always met. 


 - Deeper control into the app layer


Get real-time application server- and database-aware decisions to fully leverage available infrastructure resources 


 - Network-aware decisions to minimize latency


VMTurbo reduces “east to west” latency by placing chatty workloads next to each other without sacrificing compute and storage needs. It’s the first of its kind: network-aware control. Now fully integrated with Arista’s EOS. 

Register for the webinar today and you could win a Turbostack home lab!
