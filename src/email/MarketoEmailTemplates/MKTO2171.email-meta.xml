The reason they chose us over the any other virtualization platforms out there is because of our unique automation allowing our customers to:  ·         Increase VM to host density – increasing efficiency by 30% (and defers future hardware cost with in-depth planning capabilities)·         Increase application uptime by 35%+ ·         Decrease amount of alerts and time spent firefighting in the environment This allows our customers to save a large sum of budget usually spent on hardware, and properly allows them to plan for the new aspects of the infrastructure like a hyperconverged infrastructure, or investments in the public/private cloud offerings. &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-and-HPE-Data-Sheet.pdf]]&gt; Do you have ten minutes to discuss a potential partnership to see if we could do the same for you and the team at Jackson Health System?  Best, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   </textOnly>
