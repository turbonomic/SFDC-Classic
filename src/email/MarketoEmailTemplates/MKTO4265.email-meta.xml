    <subject>{{lead.First Name:default=}}, Last Chance -- Don&apos;t Make a Mis-STEAK</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi 
{{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 


I am following up with 
you one last time to see if you received the steak pad we sent a few weeks back. 
 
Don&apos;t make a mis-STEAK 
-- this is your last chance to receive a custom meat package from Omaha Steaks in exchange for 30-minutes of your time! We&apos;d love to share why 2000+ CIOs and companies of all sizes and industries are trusting Turbonomic to optimize their environments both on-premise and in the cloud.


Do you have 30 
minutes in the next two weeks? If so, simply respond to this email with your preferred date and time -- and I&apos;ll have a chance to apologize for my terrible pun.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!


Sincerely,


Erica Price
