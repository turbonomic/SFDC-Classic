Do you have any time over the next couple of weeks for a 30 minute introduction discussion? Right now my Thursday and Friday of next week are wide open, let me know if that might work for you.    Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; Best regards, James From: James Wilcox

Subject: Turbonomic conversation follow up: virtualization and cloud management  Dhaval, Thanks for the time today. As discussed, below is a breakdown of how Turbonomic has helped our customers around virtualization and cloud management.  Turbonomic uses patented automation at every layer of the infrastructure to provide a unique approach that is different from the VSuite of tools and does what VMware’s VRops and VSphere &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__vmturbo.wistia.com_medias_r67l1kk7i5&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=U0G0XJAMhEk_X0GAGzCL7Q&amp;r=gCM-eHqoYayWsyj2WpjQpy-xt8VFoVSjREH3qzN_pFc&amp;m=erZ9PuJjze5t-BnkoKw3YD3ubcDm5HdGJRnou-bx7q8&amp;s=53sYZb5wf_W8KiyzTM-PNOLY6alH3VAgam1tf0ILPGA&amp;e=]]&gt; can’t to allow our customers to prevent problems from ever entering their environment.  Typically teams run into three separate questions when continuing to virtualize within their infrastructure:  ·         Are the virtual machines properly sized and placed within the infrastructure so we know the applications are getting the right resources they need in order to run optimally? ·         Do we have enough capacity within our existing infrastructure to onboard X numbers of virtual machines? ·         Are the virtual machines onboard and sized properly? And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications?  Turbonomic answers all these questions for you and your infrastructure team as well as help you plan for any workloads you are looking to onboard to Azure or AWS public cloud. This allows for our customers to increase operational efficiency as alerts decrease by 80% and increase infrastructure efficiency while still assuring application performance.  Autonomic Platform for AWS &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__turbonomic.com_wp-2Dcontent_uploads_Turbonomic-2Dfor-2DAWS-2DData-2DSheet.pdf&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=U0G0XJAMhEk_X0GAGzCL7Q&amp;r=gCM-eHqoYayWsyj2WpjQpy-xt8VFoVSjREH3qzN_pFc&amp;m=erZ9PuJjze5t-BnkoKw3YD3ubcDm5HdGJRnou-bx7q8&amp;s=3mReZ6b3APbsUhioO1Tag23HlKFuCK1umYrQ0lifxGc&amp;e=]]&gt; Dhaval, if there is interest please don’t hesitate to have any member of your team reach out.  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   </textOnly>
