I know Iridium is an organization that prides itself on using the most innovative technologies to connect people and I was hoping to show you why Turbonomic is the most innovative infrastructure technology on the market.  Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks for an introduction? I am confident you will find it valuable. Best regards, James  From: James Wilcox

Subject: RE: Turbonomic conversation follow up: virtualization and cloud management  Hi Dhaval, I wanted to circle back and see if you were able to coordinate with your team at Iridium about possibly reviewing Turbonomic (formally VMTurbo) to see the many benefits it could provide for you and the team at Iridium. After doing some research it seems that the team has made a large investment in VMware and AWS and I would like to discuss how we can help out with capital savings around each of those areas for you and the team at Iridium.  Below is a newly released video that explains the benefits that BMC has seen after implementing Turbonomic on a global scale that I think you’ll find interesting. Do you have any time over the next couple of weeks for a 30 minute introduction discussion? Right now my Thursday and Friday of next week are wide open, let me know if that might work for you.   Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; Best regards, James From: James Wilcox

Subject: Turbonomic conversation follow up: virtualization and cloud management  Dhaval, Thanks for the time today.

And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications?  Turbonomic answers all these questions for you and your infrastructure team as well as help you plan for any workloads you are looking to onboard to Azure or AWS public cloud. This allows for our customers to increase operational efficiency as alerts decrease by 80% and increase infrastructure efficiency while still assuring application performance.  Autonomic Platform for AWS &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jEFVdcDII1xQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhZA0CkWTexhKDXboNHcJR6zshl9r2olmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXbw6ghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYez4166%5FU%5F%5F5h%2DCGGVf7O6830iSKKByos5R6nspxlsKSdmmzi%5Fhz5ICmHQW0sJ8tC8%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DPOQbxDmjjypZesEYRC3tjCgU6WgYh%5FFM2oTOqCzDTijrCHnriDeR3Q2HMZcG21bDmPsv4i7aPRrq19lrU2KtWM%5Fnnl6yFMTKgnZhRdVuc9MQeYCb4NnszNYxgSvuARGYxv6gGUFqdeM%2C/jU1ScMfJKVlNoVdlsbPWN7vhmzDGf5a7vvJtG%5Fjp1N8x0EZqPO%5FANQ752pxEDp5tcLSWFRYAAN0y4TNnDvWHfo9O9fhUCA%2DxVzbAl7GXPalNfrpn2c91wL211G8Ers69pkneC0AAT3xlZ0vPTbkvlnC1FLEUbE7V3l%5FAIYZuzgw7jbgBwty7ebXy%2Dn6wrkCbyCKjEnB6osCW%2Dge%5FUaw6vIc5lWAJ4HUtQtimxBTg2J8J%5Fhd99OFn1g4y8d9fbcxA8RywXz3U95byHd9%2DSISiia%5FqqKUfSREBuI8cXkaCOEGdMJq%2DemRw%5FAPXm2g9IwE3FiVwA%5FUrxwTIn3VReMAZFRmQyzwhx0ssgIBd%2DaPKvyCEJXryaDGm5xGm21SzdNIP8HGozd1zxBrVIjbm9uBMAHGgCaSMhEKbYIXukBAhQ8VbbJAeI7CI7v37xdks%5FCCJcE2f0M%2DFERdxYb02hfinks%2D4%2DdiPvjnu2VxvjBR5cTdx6Cv9ebnbASsxpbyLu%2DyzidWy6nQQ%5FFpOIxYHtg3ka90R1wn0]]&gt; Dhaval, if there is interest please don’t hesitate to have any member of your team reach out.  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jEFVdcDII1xQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhZA0CkWTexhKDXboNHcJR6zshl9r2olmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXbw6ghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYez4166%5FU%5F%5F5h%2DCGGVf7O6830iSKKByos5R6nspxlsKSdmmzi%5Fhz5ICmHQW0sJ8tC8%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DPOQbxDmjjypZesEYRC3tjCgU6WgYh%5FFM2oTOqCzDTijrCHnriDeR3Q2HMZcG21bDmPsv4i7aPRrq19lrU2KtWM%5Fnnl6yFMTKgnZhRdVuc9MQeYCb4NnszNYxgSvuARGYxv6gGUFqdeM%2C/j0lWec3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwt0x3V19ZqOQNUr7t8deF89gfdy%5FKjgaMJYwzDVXStrDbIZJw9kLAUu%2DUg%5F4g%5FXLZ5sZR7tR8M9trKuP7XMcg%2Dilu13APEhLE1UpNyLeZbA3gS%2DqOZ4lTQKU7mnUNpM2ji1FhrIXwoE%2C]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jEFVdcDII1xQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhZA0CkWTexhKDXboNHcJR6zshl9r2olmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXbw6ghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYez4166%5FU%5F%5F5h%2DCGGVf7O6830iSKKByos5R6nspxlsKSdmmzi%5Fhz5ICmHQW0sJ8tC8%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DPOQbxDmjjypZesEYRC3tjCgU6WgYh%5FFM2oTOqCzDTijrCHnriDeR3Q2HMZcG21bDmPsv4i7aPRrq19lrU2KtWM%5Fnnl6yFMTKgnZhRdVuc9MQeYCb4NnszNYxgSvuARGYxv6gGUFqdeM%2C/h0xUdMTKdlBQuVN5sfaYL6z%2D0SLJdpuno5xpHOXk3cEx1EF9PO%5FANR7ig8duCJ05OLuGNCM7KZpCxl1UI%2D%5FFRtZQ%5FPxkJxe4Ujf1tKbZO5xGZ%2DNF0%2DNN8aT220owucSrp3vlCEM7RzQ%5FQEPOTQ%2C%2C]]&gt;   </textOnly>
