Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I am excited that you will be joining our webinar From Chaos to Control tomorrow. We look forward to sharing our exciting approach to software-defined control, and demonstrating how our solution improves performance while lowering the cost of delivering compute services in your virtual data center.

We welcome questions before, during and after the session. You can submit your questions at any time during the webinar via the Questions Pane in the Control Panel. Otherwise, email me at: lauren.whitehouse@vmturbo.com.

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!

Best Regards

Lauren Whitehouse,
