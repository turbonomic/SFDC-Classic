    <subject>2 Tickets Left - VIP Invite - Luxury Suite at Warriors Game 12/14</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

With less than two days until the game I wanted to see if you would join us to celebrate the Holiday Season at our VIP executive event with Cisco Thursday night, (12/14) in a luxury suite at the Warriors game. Bill Veghte, our Executive Chairman (ex-EVP/GM Microsoft and HP) will be hosting the event.

Bill helped build Azure for Microsoft and is currently our Executive Chairman and is personally helping to lead our engineering relationship with both AWS and Microsoft. We have 1800+ customers including HP, Cisco, Conoco Phillips, Citi, JPMC, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, BMC and many more worldwide. Bill will lead a brief executive forum on today’s hybrid cloud challenges (how management risks are formidable and oversights are expensive). After which we will watch the Warriors take on the Mavericks.

I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. As space we only have two tickets left, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-sanfrancisco/]]&gt; as soon as possible or reply to this email confirming your ticket. 

Please let me know if you can make it!

Warmly,

Judi Feeley
