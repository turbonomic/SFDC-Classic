    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
I wanted to introduce myself as the new director for the Great Lakes Region here at VMTurbo. We are always trying to get a better idea of who our customers are and what challenges they are facing. With that, Iâ€™ve scheduled a webinar specifically for our customers in the Great Lakes area (I also wanted to invite you) with our founder to discuss the roadmap of VMTurbo and how we may align with your future IT Ops.
During the webinar we will be raffling off a 3 month key to ALL our control modules &lt;[[http://vmturbo.com/product/control-modules/]]&gt;
The Webinar will be held Friday, April 29, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM EST and you can register here: VMTurbo Great Lakes Webinar &lt;[[https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/5886296346322531586]]&gt;
Best,
Tom Strachan
