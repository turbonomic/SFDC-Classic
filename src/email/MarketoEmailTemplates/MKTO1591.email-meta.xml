Hi {{Lead.First Name:default=}},
Thank you for downloading VMTurbo&apos;s Virtual Health Monitor (VHM) – now you will be able to monitor for free. Forever. The way it should be.
VHM presents dashboards to list performance issues and opportunities to improve performance or efficiency. Starting from a global view of your infrastructure, you can drill down to see metrics on VMs, hosts and datastores. VHM also gives you reports that you can schedule and email to subscribers.
 Setup takes just 15 minutes – literally 15 minutes . Watch this 3-minute setup video &lt;http://vmturbo.com/download-vmturbo-virtual-health-monitor-direct/&gt;, or follow the instructions below, to get started.


 - Download  &lt;http://vmturbo.com/download-vmturbo-virtual-health-monitor-direct/&gt;the VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor

 - Deploy the Virtual Instance

 - Deploy the VMTurbo image (OVA/OVF) 

 - When you have booted the VM, you can access VMTurbo by typing the VM’s IP address in a web browser. 

 - The username and password are both administrator.




 - VMTurbo will prompt you for a license key, which will be an XML snippet. (delivered in a separate email)


Now you can monitor to your hearts content, but all of this monitoring isn&apos;t true control. To find out what true control is download our 30-day FREE trial here &lt;http://vmturbo.com/downloads/operations-manager-direct/&gt;.
