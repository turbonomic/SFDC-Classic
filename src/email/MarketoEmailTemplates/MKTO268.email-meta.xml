    <subject>VMworld  2013: Cut Through the Vendor Noise; Control Your Virtual Data Center: Get Your License to Chill</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

You’re likely receiving an onslaught of vendor emails right now in follow-up to VMworld 2013. 

So here’s why you’ll want to spend a few more minutes with this one. Rather than sending you a long sales pitch, we’ll show you the immediate value you’ll achieve with VMTurbo Operations Manager. Check out these free downloads &lt;http://bit.ly/16xSxdh&gt; to get started.

Why VMTurbo over monitoring tools? VMTurbo Operations Manager goes beyond monitoring and reporting on the state of your virtual environment. It displays recommended actions you can take to maintain optimal operating conditions, and can be configured to automatically perform the actions it prescribes—preventing contention and problems from occurring.

Your License to Chill. By reducing the complexity of 
managing virtualized IT, you can relax and focus on the other aspects of your job—with full confidence that your data center is operating in the desired state.


Sincerely,

VMTurbo VMworld 2013 Team</textOnly>
