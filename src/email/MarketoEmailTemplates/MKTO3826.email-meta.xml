Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
We’d like to invite you to an afternoon at the American Tactical Training Arms Center for an exclusive outdoor tactical shooting range event on June 28th in Jacksonville, Florida.
 
Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reimagine their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go into the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging – and mistakes are costly.
