{{lead.First Name:default=Hi there}},
At Turbonomic our mission is to be far more than just a vendor. This is why we want to take a step back, let you know that we understand your time is extremely valuable and extend an offer to partner with you to help make the world a better place.
We are excited to roll out our brand new Private Cloud Optimization Survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/X8M6NXF?marketo_papdatmihs=[marketo_papdatmihs_value]]]&gt;. We are offering a $10 Amazon gift card for completing the 3 minute survey by end of day today (November 7th). Furthermore, we are offering an additonal $50 Amazon gift card for agreeing to a 30 minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer (meeting must complete byÂ November 15th). If at the end of the meeting, you choose to engage in a proof of value, we will donate $1,000 to the 501(c)(3) charity of your choosing.
We look forward to the opportunity to speak with you around how Turbonomic is changing the IT industry for the better, but we are much more excited to partner with you to make an impact for a cause that is close to you.
