    <subject>How Cisco Achieves Success at Scale with Turbonomic</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Using Turbonomic, Cisco was able to improve VM performance by reducing resource contention by 80%, as well as become more efficient, avoiding the build-out of a new data center, saving Cisco nearly $20 Million in the process.

&quot;Turbonomic saved us 54 terabytes of memory. It saved us 4800 virtual CPU cores. And so we could add, after that reboot, another 2200 servers, for free, to the environment.&quot; - Mike Myers, Sr. Director of Cloud Orchestration &amp; Platform Services at Cisco

Schedule a Demo &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-demo/]]&gt; and learn how Turbonomic can help your IT organization optimize for performance, cost, and compliance in real-time.
