    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
 
Good morning, KubeHunters,
 
Thank you again for joining us yesterday and kicking off the KubeHunt tradition!
 
Today we have another game for you. Anyone that visits all the following KubeHunt sponsor booths can be entered into a raffle to win one of several prizes, including Google Home, Nintendo Switch, and more: that’s PlanetScale, NetApp, Twistlock, DataDog, and Turbonomic. Stop by any one of their booths to get started—they’ll give you your game card—and then you will continue your trek to the others.
 
We’ll raffle off the prizes at the  &lt;[[webextlink://We’ll raffle off the prizes at the ]]&gt;Turbonomic booth at 18:00 (6pm) today &lt;[[webextlink://Turbonomic booth at 18:00 (6pm) today]]&gt;— &lt;[[webextlink://%E2%80%94]]&gt;bring your completed game card to enter into the raffle. &lt;[[webextlink://.]]&gt; Must be present to win.
 
Also, first come first serve, there are extra KubeHunt T-shirts at the Turbonomic booth, if you want to grab one.</textOnly>
