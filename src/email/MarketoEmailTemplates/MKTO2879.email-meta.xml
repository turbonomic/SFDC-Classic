With this our customers are able to capitalize on the investment they made in virtualization and grow and scale at a lower costs.  Do you have 30 minutes for an engineer and I to provide an introduction into how this is possible to you and the team at UAB? Based on our last conversation, I am confident you will find it valuable.  Best,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
