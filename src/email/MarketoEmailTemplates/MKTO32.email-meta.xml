Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We’re looking forward to seeing you at the upcoming VMUG user conference in Chicago on September 27th! We know your day is likely filling up quickly with the various technical sessions, demonstrations and exhibits offered. That’s why we’re reaching out. We’d like to make sure VMTurbo is at the top of your agenda.
 
VMTurbo Operations Manager analyzes the real-time performance characteristics, resource capacity, system constraints and service level priorities across the virtual data center to determine, implement and adjust resource configurations and workload placement. By doing so, VMTurbo helps you meet service levels and business goals, preventing performance bottlenecks while maximizing resource efficiency. We&apos;ll make you—and your environment—more productive.
Attend our session in Breakout Block #3 (11:30am - 12:15pm) in Ballroom C titled, “Are optimized performance and high resource utilization mutually exclusive?” Here’s a preview &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/esevideo/&gt; of what we do.
We hope to see you there!
