VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor

Forever and Free, As Monitoring Should Be.

A few days back, you downloaded VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor, but it probably feels like forever ago, because you haven’t yet activated your appliance. Request your license key here &lt;http://bit.ly/1gpucA3&gt;.

Activate    now, and within minutes you’ll gain mountaintop visibility into your    virtual environment, wielding the power to identify problems in real    time. Performance reports? All yours. In perpetuity. Forever.O

Once you&apos;ve deployed VHM, the initial credentials are administrator for username and password. The setup wizard will handle the rest.

In good health,
VMTurbo
