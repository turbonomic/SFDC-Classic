    <textOnly>Hi Eric, 
 With baseball season underway and summer right around the corner, I want to make sure you have a chance to spend some time cheering on the Rangers in Arlington. 
 Turbonomic is giving away a pair of Rangers tickets to the game of your choice for simply scheduling a 30-minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer during the month of May. 
 Schedule your meeting here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/turbonomic-rangers-game-summer-giveaway/]]&gt;, and we will get you over to Globe Life Park! 
 Best, CatherineÂ
