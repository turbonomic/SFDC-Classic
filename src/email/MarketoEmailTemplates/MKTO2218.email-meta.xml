There are many different ways that customers see value in Turbonomic whether it’s through saving on VMware licensing costs, SQL licensing costs &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/videos/turbonomic-customer-success-story-aci-payment-systems/]]&gt;, deferment of future hardware spend or through increased application response time and many others.  Do you have time to set up an introduction call this week or next to discuss where you and the team at Lee County Schools can see value in Turbonomic and help with some of the initiatives you have planned for 2017?  Best regards, James  From: James Wilcox

Subject: RE: Dwayne - Reducing infrastructure CapEx  Dwayne – Typically teams run into three separate questions when continuing to virtualize within their infrastructure:  ·         Are the virtual machines properly sized and placed within the infrastructure so we know the applications are getting the right resources they need in order to run optimally? ·         Do we have enough capacity within our existing infrastructure to onboard X numbers of virtual machines? ·         Are the virtual machines we are onboarding sized properly? And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications?  Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks to discuss how Turbonomic helps teams answer the questions mentioned above and could do the same fr you and the team at Lee Schools? Currently I am available any time after 1 pm EST both Wednesday and Thursday of next week. Let me know if that might work for you.   Best regards, James From: James Wilcox

Subject: RE: Dwayne - Reducing infrastructure CapEx  Hi Dwayne, I wanted to follow up on the email I sent in February to see if there might be interest in reviewing Turbonomic. I know the email I sent before was wordy but in short, Turbonomic helps our customers save on CapEx and OpEx usually thrown at the infrastructure by:  Assure Application Performance in Real Time o   80% decrease in tickets and alerts (become more operationally efficient) o   Preventing problems before they become issues (we are the only platform that does this) Drive Efficiency in Environment  o   40% increase in VM/Host Density as workloads get the intelligence to dictate the resources they need, saving hundreds of thousands of CapEx in the infrastructure.Capacity Plano   Forecasting and tons of “what-if” scenarios around h/w refresh, DC moves, Consolidations etc...I know that it is very important for counties to save any way they can and Turbonomic allows our customers to do just that in the most expensive part of IT, the infrastructure. Do you have just fifteen minutes to discuss Turbonomic a bit further and see if Lee County Schools could also see the following benefits that City of Miami and Orange County saw after installing Turbonomic? Best regards, James From: James Wilcox

Subject: Dwayne - Reducing infrastructure CapEx  Dwayne,  I can see that you and the infrastructure team at Lee County School District made a significant investment in VMWare’s hypervisor technologies a few years back. I was hoping that you and the team might have some time to over the next few weeks to have a fifteen minute conversation around Turbonomic’s control platform and how it helps our customers capitalize on the investment they made in virtualization. In short, Turbonomic allows our customers like Orange County School District, the City of Miami and Everbank (to name local customers) to increase application performance by taking a different approach &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/differentiation/]]&gt;, allowing the applications to dictate the resources they need in real time automation. With this, our customers are able to also increase VM to host density, allowing them to spend less on hardware saving them hundreds of thousands. With the preventative automation you will also no longer have to spend time firefighting within the environment as there will be no more alerts.  Dwayne, do you have time this week to discuss further? I’d like to see if there is a chance for a partnership between Turbonomic and provide a high level introduction to my regional director for Florida. Both our Wednesday and Thursday are open between 2-4 pm EST, let me know if that will work for you or feel free to propose another time.  Best regards, James Wilcox  Sales Representative – Southeast Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
