Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I wanted to make sure you didn&apos;t miss the chance to participate in our cloud migration survey as we explore the challenges facing organizations on their journey to hybrid cloud.

 &lt;[[http://bit.ly/2KQU2Sd]]&gt;

I hope that you&apos;ll take 3 minutes to share your experiences with us. As a thank you for your time, those who complete this survey &lt;[[http://bit.ly/2KQU2Sd]]&gt; will receive a $10 Amazon Gift Card.

Furthermore, we are offering a $100 Amazon Gift Card at the end of the survey if you agree to a meet with a Turbonomic engineer (meeting must complete by July 27th). If at the end of your meeting, you choose to engage in a proof of value, we will make a $300 donation to the 501(c)(3) charity of your choosing.

We look forward to the opportunity to partner with you to make an impact in an organization that is important to you.



Regards,
