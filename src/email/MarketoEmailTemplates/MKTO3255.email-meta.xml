    <textOnly>HiÂ {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


I hope you are as excited as I am to hang out with the Turbonomic and Presidio crew tonight at the Golf Club at Chelsea Piers. When you arrive, please look for me in the lobby area, I will be wearing a Turbonomic golf polo so I should be easy to spot, and I will guide you to our bays!
Thursday, September 28th, 5:30 p.m. EST
The Golf Club at Chelsea Piers &lt;[[https://www.chelseapiers.com/golf/driving-range/overview/]]&gt;

See you soon,

Megan
