Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Kubernetes-as-a-Service offerings are popping up everywhere now that organizations are bought in and need a way to more quickly build services and container deployments. Join us on August 22, 2018, at 11am ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/self-managing-kubernetes-as-a-service/]]&gt; as we discuss:


	- What is KaaS?

	- Cloud KaaS Considerations—think portability, interoperability, and extensibility

	- KaaS Capabilities Comparisons—because everyone loves a matrix

	- Early Business Differentiators We’re Seeing Across Cloud KaaSes

	- What KaaS Is Not

	- And of course, we’ll demo self-managing Kubernetes-as-a-Service, soon to be available for EKS, AKS, GKE, and PKS



 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/self-managing-kubernetes-as-a-service/]]&gt;

Turbonomic enables these deployments to continuously self-manage, freeing Devops and Operator teams to focus on applications and the business—not resource optimization. Whether you’re just starting your Kubernetes journey or all-in KaaS, there’s something for you.



We hope to see you there!
