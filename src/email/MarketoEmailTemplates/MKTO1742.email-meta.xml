Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
In October VMTurbo conducted an industry survey to investigate the challenges organizations are facing to maintain software licensing compliance in todayâ€™s rapidly-growing virtualized and cloud environment, as well as the strategies they employ to meet these challenges.
Over 1,400 Enterprise IT and data center professionals responded to our survey and the results uncovered some very interesting insights into the communal experience of vendors&apos; licensing structures, and how organizations like yours are fighting back. You aren&apos;t alone in the fight against software licensing!
Some of the key findings include:




 - 51% of respondents check to ensure license compliance just once per year OR only when audited by the vendor
 - 41% of respondents find that visibility into license consumption is their greatest challenge in maintaining license compliance. Click below to read the full report free!
