{{lead.First Name:default=Hi there}},

It’s that time of year again – the season of giving, getting… and reflection. 2017 brought self-driving cars, self-healing systems, and self-managing data centers to the fore, with various degrees of artificial intelligence making it possible. Will 2018 be the year AI becomes ubiquitous? 
 
Let’s find out together. AppDynamics, Red Hat, StackPointCloud, and Turbonomic have joined together to collectively establish a baseline for where organizations are currently on their hybrid cloud journey and the role that AI plays—or will play—in making that journey successful.
 
Your participation is integral to the completion of the report, which we will 
publish in January 2018. The survey will take approximately ten (10) minutes to complete. For your time, you will be entered for a chance to win one (1) of ten (10) $100 Amazon Gift Cards.*
