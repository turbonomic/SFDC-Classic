Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

You’re busy – fighting fires and chasing down issues consumes too much of your team’s time and focus – and it’s becoming more complex as you expand virtualization and adopt cloud services.
 
Rather than seeking a faster way to put out the fires, why not strive to maintain your systems and applications in a healthy state, thus preventing issues from igniting in the first place?
 
We have a better approach to automate control of your virtualized environment. It’s being used by hundreds of other organizations like BT, CSC, Coca-Cola, VeriSign, and Indiana University to drive down costs, improve virtual workload performance and maximize resource utilization. Our Software-Defined Control system automates the decision-making process for your IT ops team and provides intelligent actions that maintain your virtual environment in a healthy state.

Thank you,

VMTurbo Team
