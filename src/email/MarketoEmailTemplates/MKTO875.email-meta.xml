3 Tips for Admins &amp; Architects
Network-heavy, scale-out workloads place considerable stress on today’s rapidly growing virtualized and cloud datacenters. Non-delimiting network components, as well as emerging software-defined networking (SDN) technologies aim to mitigate the potential bottlenecks that can precipitate at the network layer in such environments, as well as simplify network design. However, there remain significant challenges, as well as optimization opportunities, at the network layer.
This whitepaper &lt;http://vmturbo.com/network-flow-and-application-performance?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=35000decisions&amp;utm_content=ncmwp112514&gt; examines the latency-inducing pitfalls of common  VM placement tactics, as well as a network flow approach that minimizes network, compute, and storage latency all at once.
