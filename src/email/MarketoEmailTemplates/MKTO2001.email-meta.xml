    <subject>Capacity Planning Fundamentals: How To Better Scale The Data Center</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://turbonomic.com/thx-wp-capacity-planning-and-capacity-management-thank-you?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=capacityplanningwp&amp;utm_content=12022016]]&gt;
{{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
As organizations scale, planning for greater application workload demand is critical. IT cannot afford to be seen as a bottleneck to successful business growth. Moreover, the larger the organization and the faster the growth the higher the stakes.
The reality is that smarter capacity planning starts with a better understanding of the virtual environments and the interdependencies of data center entities.
In this e-Book you will learn:


	- The foundation for making intelligent capacity projections
	- Resource consumption and how to think about their allocation
	- Ways to assure application QoS as you provision
	- How to manage fast growing physical and virtual environments
	- A solution to managing the complex environment using economic abstractions and “what-if” scenarios
