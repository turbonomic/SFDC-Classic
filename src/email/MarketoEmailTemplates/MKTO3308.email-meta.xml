    <subject>Join Us -  Hybrid Cloud Executive Networking Dinner with Turbonomic CMO Tom Murphy</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

I’d like to follow up on my previous invitation and remind you of Turbonomic and Cisco&apos;s Executive Networking Dinner on Tuesday, November 14th at Mastro&apos;s City Hall Steakhouse &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-phoenix/]]&gt;. At dinner we will discuss the challenges and benefits of operating in a hybrid cloud model as well as how Turbonomic and Cisco customers are leveraging Turbonomic&apos;s hybrid cloud management platform to assure performance, enforce compliance and economize their human, operational and capital expenses on their cloud journeys.

During dinner there will be ample time to socialize with some of the brightest IT minds in Phoenix and exchange ideas on how to solve the complex issues you face today. In addition to networking, I will discuss the landscape surrounding the cloud and provide an overview of the Turbonomic platform and how organizations including HP, Cisco, DXC, DellEMC and BMC have transformed their IT strategy leveraging Turbonomic’s patented analytics. All our VIPs in attendance will receive a special gift.

I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. As space is limited, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-phoenix/]]&gt; as soon as possible.

Yours Sincerely,

Tom Murphy
