Feature #4: Workload Chart


The Workload Chart is the place in Turbonomic that answers the following question:



	- What is the state of my entire virtual and physical infrastructure?


Step-By-Step: Workload Chart





The following steps will guide you through the Workload Chart:



	- Rings on the Workload Chart represent groups of VMs across the environment whose Host and Datastore utilizations correspond to the position of each ring relative to the X and Y axes (in the Workload Chart, X and Y should both be considered Independent Variables). Colored arcs represent the utilization levels of the most constraining resource on subsets of VMs in each ring: Red = Critically Overutilized, Yellow = Overutilized, Green = Desired Utilization, and Blue = Underutilized. It is important to understand that although these VMs are grouped together on the Workload Chart, they do not necessarily reside close together within the environment.
	- Use the Gear Icon to change the Workload Chart axes
	- Draw a box around any of the rings in the Workload Chart to display the specific VMs, Hosts, and Datastores contained in the ring, as well as Actions associated with these entities

	- Click the name of any entity in the Selected VMs window to view additional detail on utilization, resources, related entities, Actions, and the Audit Log - which will show any Actions that have been taken on the selected entity
