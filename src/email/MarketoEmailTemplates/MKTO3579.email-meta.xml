    <subject>Turbonomic New Partner Program Launch – You’re Invited!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
This is a very exciting time for Turbonomic and our partner ecosystem.
Cloud computing and what it represents is completely transforming how customers are delivering IT services and support, creating massive market opportunities.
It is this opportunity that is the catalyst behind the complete re-engineering of our partner program that will deliver even greater customer value and partner profitability.
This new program, along with our workload automation technology which makes customers workloads “SMART” (self-manage in real-time), will put you at the heart of this disruption.
Join us on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 1:00pm ET to learn how you leverage our new partner program to capitalize this market shift. During this session, you’ll hear about: 



	- NEW! Partner Program Paths 

	- NEW! Competitive Discounts &amp; Incentives

	- NEW! Partner Portal

	- NEW! Tools &amp; Resources

	- NEW! Sales, Technical &amp; Post-Sales Partner Accreditations

	- NEW! Market Development Funds (MDF) Program 

	- NEW! Marketing Campaigns
