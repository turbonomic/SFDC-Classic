    <textOnly>Platform and Partnership Updates
With the Holidays in full swing and the Year’s End quickly approaching, on behalf of all of us here at Turbonomic: THANK YOU, our customers, for your trust and partnership. 
 
While 2018 has been an incredibly exciting year, we’re already looking forward to all that 2019 will hold! This includes helping you achieve your 2019 cloud goals… and beyond! For example, did you know that our real-time capabilities and AI-driven decision engine enables the best use of reserved capacity in AWS &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/optimize-public-cloud-spend/live-demo-featuring-new-continuous-aws-reserved-instance-consumption]]&gt; and Azure? To take advantage of this powerful capability, maximize the value you’re getting from the Turbonomic platform and much more, be sure that you’re running Turbonomic 6.2. And, remember that your Turbonomic maintenance includes upgrades and updates. Reach out to our team and get access to the very latest.

plays.
