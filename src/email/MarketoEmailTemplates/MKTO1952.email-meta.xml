    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Partner}}, 
As you saw in our January Monthly Newsletter &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-4317]]&gt;, Turbonomic is had a recent valuation at $800M in our last round of funding, and we&apos;re only going to continue to grow. We are excited about the opportunity for our partners to grow with us! 

Our annual Partner Town Hall Meeting &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/q1-17-partner-town-hall-meeting/]]&gt; is this week on Wednesday, February 15th at 11:00 AM EST is an opportunity for you hear more about our strategy for how you, as partners, can grow with us. 
If you haven&apos;t already done so, be sure to reserve &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/q1-17-partner-town-hall-meeting/]]&gt; your spot today!
I look forward to seeing you on the call,


Sean Finnegan
