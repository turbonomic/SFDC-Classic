I understand that you have had conversations with a few of my colleges in the past and I wanted to reach out to let you know that we are running a special promotion for meeting with us over the next month! If you complete an introductory meeting with Turbonomic before June 23rd, we will enter you in a raffle to win a trip for two (2) to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game in Miami, Florida from July 9 - 12, 2017.  If you’d like to be entered, you can visit this page &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/mlb-all-star-experience-giveaway/]]&gt;, or just let me know and I will work with you directly to schedule our meeting and put you into the raffle. I would love the opportunity to meet with you to see if Turbonomic would be valuable to you and your team.  Thanks,Maggie Margaret Schroeder - Turbonomic
