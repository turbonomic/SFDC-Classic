Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
I&apos;m here at re:Invent, presenting on cloud elasticity, paneling on multi-cloud, and meeting with end-users to discuss how they leverage and benefit from AWS.
Throughout the week I will be putting together key highlights from new product announcements, roadmap updates, and break-out presentations so I can share everything with those of you who aren&apos;t able to join me in Las Vegas.
