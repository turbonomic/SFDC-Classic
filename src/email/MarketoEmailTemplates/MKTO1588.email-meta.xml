Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Partner}},
You&apos;re invited to join us TOMORROW for a special webinar featuring EMC XtremIO to learn about how to assure the performance of I/O intensive workloads at scale.  
During this webinar you can expect to learn the following: 



 - How to assure application quality of service across all flash and heterogeneous storage environments
 - What does it take to enable massive mixed workload consolidation for multiple Tier 1 workloads
 - Why real-time automatable placement, sizing and provision decisions at every layer of the stack enable performance control
 - How you can provision 1000s of VMs instantly with no overhead, no SLA risk, and no infrastructure impact

 - Why the hypervisor integrations matter for large-scale virtual environments
