Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
As the summer doldrums wane, we here at Turbonomic are firing all cylinders in preparation for VMworld! I would like to offer you an exclusive invitation to a 30-minute meeting with members of our executive team at VMworld in Las Vegas (August 27th – 30th, 2017). In your on-site briefing at Mandalay Bay, you will gain VIP insight into Turbonomic’s roadmap and all the current capabilities of our hybrid cloud management platform.
Our 5.9 Release, issued in June, was our most advanced ever - featuring a brand new HTML5 user interface and a host of capabilities enabling customers to minimize costs, assure performance and enforce compliance across all clouds from VMware to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
We would be delighted to schedule you with any of the following executives at VMworld. Simply let us know by requesting a meeting here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/leadership-meetings/]]&gt;.
