Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

It was great to meet and spend some time with you at VMware Forum on 2nd May – thanks for taking the time to come by and see us.   As a follow-up to the show, I wanted to point you at several resources designed to dive deeper into the ways VMTurbo will dramatically improve how you control and automate your virtual data center.


 - Our Trial Download &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt;
 - Our online Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://bit.ly/Yz66Yv&gt;
 - This technical whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/10xbpFp&gt;


We will be following up with you shortly to understand your priorities and interest in learning more about VMTurbo. If you would like to set up some time to get a more in-depth, tailored demonstration of our solution, please let us know here &lt;http://bit.ly/145VraT&gt;. 

Kind regards
