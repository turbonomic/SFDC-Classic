Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Since we connected at the last UK VMUG we wanted to let you know we&apos;re sponsoring the National UK VMUG User Conference again this year on November 15th, at the National Motor Cycle Museum. We&apos;d love to catch up with you regarding your progress in virtualizing your data center — and share the new innovations and features in VMTurbo Operations Manager. 

VMTurbo Operations Manager analyzes the real-time performance characteristics, resource 
capacity, system constraints and service level priorities across the virtual data center to determine, implement, and continuously adjust resource allocations and workload placement.  By doing so, VMTurbo helps you meet service levels and business goals, preventing performance bottlenecks 
while maximizing resource efficiency.  The control and automation that VMTurbo provides is unparalleled to other solutions in the market today.  We&apos;ll make you — and your environment — more productive, just as we did for our UK customer, LSE.  Here&apos;s what they have to 
say &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/who-uses-us/customer-success-stories/&gt; about VMTurbo Operations Manager.

You have until Monday, November 12th to register &lt;https://vmug.socious.com/index.php?mo=cm&amp;op=ld&amp;fid=212&gt;. Please stop by our booth or join our educational session &quot;Can You Manage Your Virtual Infrastructure So That Optimized Performance and High Resource Utilization are Not Mutually Exclusive?&quot; in breakout block #5 (15.15-16.00) in the Waterloo Suite.

Our CEO, Lou 
Shipley, will also be in attendance and looks forward to meeting you!

Sincerely,
The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
