    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
Are you going to HPE Discover next week? Well we are. We’ll be at booth #702 and showcasing our latest integration with HPE OneView.
With VMTurbo and HPE OneView you&apos;ll be able to:


 - Guarantee the performance of any application
 - Accelerate your transition to hybrid-cloud infrastructure
 - Deliver cloud-like economics on-premises


Think that’s too good to be true? Come by booth #702 and we’ll show you a demo.
We’ll also be raffling off a Fitbit, Beats Headphones &amp; a Drone. If you can’t make it but want to learn more schedule a demo today &lt;[[http://vmturbo.com/product/request-a-demo/]]&gt;
Hope to see you there.
