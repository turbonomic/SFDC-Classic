Hi Regina,
Thank you for completing the Turbonomic Cloud Readiness Survey. You should receive your Amazon Gift Card shortly.
Although you stated you’re not currently planning for a cloud migration, I can offer you another $100 Amazon Gift Card if I can schedule 30 minutes between you and a Turbonomic Engineer for a brief introduction. You indicated on your survey several Cloud Readiness challenges that Turbonomic directly addresses, specifically:
	- Reduce capital expenditures - Turbonomic has been proven to reduce infrastructure requirements by 30% or more through intelligent consolidation	- Reduce operational expenditures - Turbonomic has been proven to decrease performance alerts by 80% or more through its patented automation engine	- Cloud cost forecasting - Turbonomic projects future monthly AWS and Azure bills so your teams can accurately plan and budget	- Anti-affinity enforcement - Turbonomic imports existing affinity and anti-affinity policies from your on-prem environment, while also extending this capability to the public cloud to ensure applications are distributed among availability zones, regions, or any other required permutation across the hybrid infrastructure

Although it seems that the cloud migration project is something that is an initiative for further in the future, I’d still be happy to set up a 30 minute educational overview discussion to show you how Turbo solves the challenges you mentioned above. 
Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks for a quick introduction? If, after our call, you decide to evaluate Turbonomic as a solution, we will make a donation in your name of $1,000 to any charity of your choice.Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
