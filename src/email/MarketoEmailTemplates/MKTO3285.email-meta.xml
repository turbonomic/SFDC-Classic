Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Analysts and experts predict that the end state of the current IT evolution is an architecture called hybrid cloud, whereby an organization delivers application services out of multiple virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud availability zones. 
Verizon and Turbonomic have recently collaborated on a survey series, which aims to establish a baseline for where organizations currently reside along this journey, and to establish a framework for proceeding on the path to hybrid cloud over the next three years.
In part 1, we highlight:


	- The State of Public Cloud

	- The State of Private Cloud

	- The State of Multi-Cloud



Download this report to learn how your organization stacks up: How long will it take you? How much will it cost you? What challenges lie ahead when you adopt Multi-Cloud?
