    <subject>Don&apos;t Overprovision to Increase Performance</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

All too often we see customers who, before working with Turbonomic, have severely overprovisioned their on-premise IT environment with the hope of increasing performance.

When they decide to migrate to the cloud, their prior overprovisioning leads to unexpected and high operating expenses.

 &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/accelerate-cloud-migration-projects]]&gt;

To help you get ahead of this common trap, we have curated our best content on Cloud Migrations, so you can properly educate yourselves before you miss any deadlines or budgets.

Regards, 
Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
