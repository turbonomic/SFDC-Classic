Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},



With public cloud adoption growing rapidly, it’s becoming clear that a plan to optimize your existing footprint is no longer a “nice-to-have,” it&apos;s a need to have. 
How can you go beyond surface-level optimization to unlock cost savings in the public cloud?







Register Now &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-reduce-cloud-bill/]]&gt;







Join us tomorrow at 11 am ET for our webinar where Mor Cohen-Tal, Cloud CTO at Turbonomic, discusses the 5 steps to cloud optimization:


	- Understanding your Applications
	- Understanding the Cloud Catalog
	- Defining Guardrails &amp; Optimizing Low Hanging Fruit
	- and more!



As one of the very first Turbonomic employees, Mor started her career as a software engineer and has earned seven patents. She&apos;s helped hundreds of customers architect their public cloud strategy. 

I hope you&apos;ll join us! Register now &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-reduce-cloud-bill/]]&gt; and enter to win a $100 Amazon Gift Card.
