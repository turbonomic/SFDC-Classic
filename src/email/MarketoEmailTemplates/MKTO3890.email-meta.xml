    <subject>3 Hours Could Save You 30% On Your Cloud Bill</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product-3/why-turbonomic]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

A few days ago, I learned that in one hour, Turbonomic found $2M worth of additional savings annually in the AWS environment of a long-time CloudHealth customer – along with over 500 performance critical risks due to inadequate resources.

Turbonomic also recently uncovered:



	- 30% additional monthly savings in a CloudCheckr (AWS) environment 

	- 40% additional monthly savings in a Cloudyn (Azure) environment

	- 74% additional monthly savings in a highly-advanced custom tooling (AWS) environment




Would it be worth three hours of your time for Turbonomic to save you at least 30% off your annual cloud bill – and identify hidden performance risks before your customers do?

Let&apos;s chat. &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-demo/?nab=1]]&gt;
