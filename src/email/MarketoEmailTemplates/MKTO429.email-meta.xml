    <textOnly>   
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


OOZ is VMTurbo&apos;s acronym for the Optimal Operating Zone, the state in which application performance is assured while resources are utilized as efficiently as possible. To achieve it, VMTurbo Operations Manager continuously adjusts and tunes the managed entities across the virtual environment to reduce contention and ensure resources are available. How do we do it and, more importantly, how can you do it? Watch this video &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/esevideo&gt; to learn more. 

If you’re ready to Converge your environment to the OOZ, let’s get going!  First, check out the &quot;Achieving OOZ&quot; video &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/eval-tutorial-converge/&gt; for a demonstration regarding reviewing and following recommendations to improve performance and efficiency.
