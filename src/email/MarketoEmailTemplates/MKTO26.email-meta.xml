    <subject>New VMTurbo Release: a better way to control cloud and virtualized data centers</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Today we are very excited to announce the release of VMTurbo Operations Manager 3.2. There are a number of enhancements and new capabilities included and we are looking forward to seeing them utilized by our rapidly growing customer base.

Not an email person? Get more detail here on our blog &lt;http://bit.ly/SZsklq&gt;, grab a seat for our release webinar &lt;http://bit.ly/OX2Cbg&gt; or just go ahead and download &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; the free trial of the product (highly recommended!).

So, what&apos;s new? A few of the important new features in this release are:

 - Intelligent workload onboarding – close the loop in planning, building and controlling virtual environments by deploying new workloads with the same analytic engine that ensures optimal configuration of the existing virtual infrastructure.
 - Java and Linux application integration – auto-discover and control resource allocation based on application priority for virtualized Windows, Java and Linux applications.
 - Which of these virtualization and cloud platforms is new to the table: XenServer, Hyper-V, vSphere, vCloud Director, CloudStack, or RHEV? Either way, they are all supported and controllable from a single VMTurbo Ops Manager virtual appliance.

Want more detail? Check out our product announcement blog &lt;http://bit.ly/SZsklq&gt;. You can also register to attend our New Release Webinar &lt;http://bit.ly/OX2Cbg&gt; on September 25th hosted by Yuri Rabover, our VP of Product Strategy, which will run through a quick demonstration of the new functionality.

Existing users should go ahead and apply the simple upgrade to their environment. And, if you have yet to experience the product, take our free 30 day trial &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; offer. The product deploys as an easy-to-install virtual appliance and delivers actionable and automatable recommendations to improve performance across your virtual infrastructure—in less than 30 minutes.
