    <subject>Have you hit the 50% threshold?</subject>

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


According to a June 2012 Gartner report, Magic Quadrant for x86 Server Virtualization Infrastructure, “more than 50% of x86 architecture workloads have been virtualized on servers, and the market is in the middle of its fastest expansion to date.”  Growth in the quantity of workloads (including those for business-critical applications and virtual desktops) is expected to continue at a rapid clip. VMTurbo believes that as virtualization environments scale, greater visibility and analytics that drive automation of IT processes will be needed.


Whether your virtualized infrastructure has pushed past the 50% mark or you’re just starting out, the complexities of assuring service performance while also getting the most out of your virtual infrastructure is likely a concern.  Get either wrong and it can cost you—economically or with your reputation. That’s where VMTurbo comes in. VMTurbo Operations Manager properly sizes and continuously adjusts your workload placement and virtual infrastructure to deliver successfully on both goals: performance assurance and efficient utilization.
