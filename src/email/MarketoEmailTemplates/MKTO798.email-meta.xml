Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Traditional operations managers - yes, even the so-called &quot;Best in Breed&quot; operations managers  - are simplistic, threshold-based monitoring tools that send  alerts  when static thresholds are breached. Some of the alerts are meaningful.  Many are false positives. In every case, this method of managing IT is  not scalable for controlling the dynamism of the cloud era.

VMTurbo  manages in a fundamentally different way, leveraging the complexity and  dynamism of your environment to continually control it where service  levels are assured on the most efficient hardware footprint possible.

VMTurbo Control &lt;http://bit.ly/1mf8ttg&gt; extends throughout the stack:

 - Application Control Module &lt;http://bit.ly/1tOO427&gt;
 - Capacity Planner &lt;http://bit.ly/1knaYep&gt;
 - Fabric Control Module &lt;http://bit.ly/1nubWZe&gt;
 - Hybrid Cloud Control Module &lt;http://bit.ly/1nAF9zq&gt;
 - Storage Control Module &lt;http://bit.ly/TTnEjc&gt;

Visibility is a fraction of the equation. Take control.

Your IT control system,
