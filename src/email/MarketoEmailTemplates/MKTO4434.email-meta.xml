    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Gartner expects that CIOs who believe they can get by with their current level of data center intelligence in 2023 will no longer be at their posts. The survival of their business cannot be guaranteed.* Don&apos;t let this happen to you and your team.
