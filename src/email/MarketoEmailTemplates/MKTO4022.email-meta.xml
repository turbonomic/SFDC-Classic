Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


As of our customers I would like to invite you to attend our 2018 Customer Summit on 18th September at the Intercontinental Park Lane, London, UK.
This event brings together eco-system partners and customers, in the same forum, to learn more about Turbonomics vision and direction from our leadership 
team. Charles Crouchman, CTO will take you through our product roadmap. Chris Gorecki, VP of Global Channel and Alliances discuss the new Turbonomic partner program and how you can leverage it to accelerate 
profitability. Lastly you will hear from customers such as Orange, who have deployed our workload automation technology to increase efficiency and assure performance in their datacenter and public clouds. We will also have some exciting guest speakers who will be announced soon.
This event is free to attend and is by invitation only.  Space is limited so we strongly urge you to register as soon as possible to reserve your seat. The event is 
Free to attend, refreshments will be provided throughout the day with an exclusive business lunch provided in private at Ella Canta &lt;[[https://www.ellacanta.com]]&gt; by executive chef Martha Ortiz.
