VMTurbo is the only software-driven control platform in the market today, automatically assuring application performance while maximizing utilization of your existing infrastructure. The system is designed to close the loop of operations management, from planning “what-if” scenarios, to deploying new workloads, to controlling the environment in its’ most desired state, and also reporting on historical trends and improvements achieved by the system. VMTurbo installs in a matter of minutes without any agents and without touching any databases.

In a recent TechValidate survey of VMTurbo customers:

 - 89% of customers gained an ROI within 3 months, and 24% realized this value within 3 days of deploying VMTurbo
 - 80% of customers increased utilization by more than 20% since deploying VMTurbo
 - 55% of customers increased IT staff productivity by more than 20% since deploying VMTurbo

It’s not enough to simply gain visibility to your virtual environment through monitoring and reporting tools; to realize your full ROI on virtualization and private/hybrid cloud you must Define, Drive, and Control the environment through software. VMTurbo is the only vendor with a solution for this. We hope you join the webinar, if not the revolution.</textOnly>
