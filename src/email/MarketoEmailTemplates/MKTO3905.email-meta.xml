    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We’re sorry to have missed you at last night’s Turbonomic IT Networking Dinner.
 
Although we weren’t able to speak with you, we wanted to let you know about an upcoming webinar taking place on July 25th, during which we will be discussing our integration with Microsoft Azure. You can register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-azure/]]&gt;.
 
Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions. We hope to see you at another Turbonomic event soon!






Regards,
The Turbonomic Team</textOnly>
