I’ve worked with a number of governmental institutions including the Department of Energy – Energy Information Administration, and National Science Foundation to alleviate their IT infrastructure management challenges. They generally run within a July budget cycle and occasionally have remaining funds towards the end of their fiscal year. I typically find these customers bear one of two prevalent problems:
	- Their IT environments are highly fragmented, marked by high inefficiency and/or their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resources.	- Their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resources.
 Turbonomic directly addresses both of these challenges. With that in mind, we’d like to offer a $15,000 discount for any deal with us, if you install Turbonomic’s autonomic performance platform before the end of May. 
Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction to you and the team at City of Alexandria over the next couple of weeks?  Best regards, Going to Cisco Live?
