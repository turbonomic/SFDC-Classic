Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

The VMTurbo Online Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://bit.ly/OM1c42&gt; is officially open for business.
As  someone who previously downloaded our Operations Manager product, this  site has been designed to give you all the tips and tricks to  understanding (and getting immediate value from) all of the capabilities  included in our solution – and provide one-click access to experts who  can assist you on your way.

If you are currently evaluating the  product, take advantage of tutorials &lt;http://bit.ly/OM1c42&gt; that  have been organized to help you immediately converge your virtual  environment to an optimal state, and control it in the future – ensuring  your workloads have the resources they need and  the underlying  infrastructure is optimally utilized.

If it has been awhile since  you gave the product a spin – take this opportunity to download  &lt;http://bit.ly/QEctqh&gt; our updated 3.1 virtual appliance today.  You’ll have it up and running in less than 30 minutes. Stop reacting to  alerts and drilling into data, start preventing problems and maintaining  your virtual data center in a healthy state.

We look forward to working with you through your experience with our solution.

Thank you,

 Derek Slayton
 VP of Marketing, VMTurbo
