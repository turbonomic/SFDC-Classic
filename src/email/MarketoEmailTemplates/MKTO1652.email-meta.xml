    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir or Madam}}:
As a valued customer, we would like to extend an invitation to VMTurbo’s second annual Turbofest London at The Royal Institution.
This afternoon event will be held on Thursday, May 19th at 21 Albemarle St, London W1S 4BS with presentations starting at 1:00 PM.
The program features cloud and virtualisation thought leadership discussions, customer keynotes, and an inside look at the 2016 VMTurbo Roadmap. The evening will conclude at 7:00 PM following networking, cocktails, and a science demonstration that is sure to be explosive!
Last year we heard from industry authorities such as Barclays and SNS Bank as they discussed their thoughts around OpenStack, SDN, and future trends in the software defined data centre. Since last year, a lot has changed and indeed continues to change—thus it begs the question, whats next?
Due to space considerations, Turbofest London is limited to the first 100 VIP registrants. I look forward to seeing you there.
