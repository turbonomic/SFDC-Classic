Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},





On behalf of JR Butler, Vice President at Turbonomic, we&apos;d like to cordially invite you to an exclusive 
networking event followed by a hockey game at the Philadelphia Flyers take on the Carolina Hurricanes on April 5, at the Wells Fargo Center.
 Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, 
leading many organizations to reimagine their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging – and mistakes are costly. This is exacerbated even further once customers get to the cloud and need to manage its complexity.


Philadelpia Executive Networking event 
Philadelphia Flyers vs Carolina Hurricanes
Thursday, April 5th | Wells Fargo Center | 6:30 p.m.



We hope you will join us for this discussion by registering at the following link: http://turbonomic.com/vip-philadelphia &lt;[[turbonomic.com/philadelphia]]&gt;






Sincerely,


The Turbonomic Team</textOnly>
