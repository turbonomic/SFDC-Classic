    <subject>46% Of VDI Projects Stall, Donâ€™t Let Yours Be One Of Them</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
 &lt;http://vmturbo.com/vmturbo-webcast-opensky-vdi-orchestration?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wcast_love&amp;utm_content=wcast&gt;

We love webinars &lt;http://vmturbo.com/vmturbo-webcast-opensky-vdi-orchestration?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wcast_love&amp;utm_content=wcast&gt;, they&apos;re informative, quick, and far superior to reading. In fact we love them so much that we want to share them with you! 

Join OpenSky&apos;s Don McKeith to learn how he helped a Fortune 50 International Health Insurer develop a ground-up orchestration framework for its virtual infrastructure, and onboard more than 25,000 zero-downtime VDI seats in less than four years.

How quickly could {{company.company name:default=your company}} scale if the business called for it? Watch here to glean insights for your team directly from Mr. McKeith.
