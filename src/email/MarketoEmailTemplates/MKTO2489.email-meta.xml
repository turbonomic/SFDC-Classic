 John - Thank you for completing the Turbonomic IT Maturity Survey! You should receive your Amazon Gift Card shortly.
I can offer you another $100 Amazon Gift Card or a $100 donation to a charity of your choice if I can schedule 30 minutes between you and a Turbonomic Engineer. You indicated on your survey several challenges that Turbonomic directly addresses, specifically:
	- Troubleshooting/Proactive Monitoring - Turbonomic has been proven to decrease performance alerts by 80% or more through its patented automation engine	- Administrative Costs (High Admin: Workload Ratio) - Turbonomic has been proven to empower organizations to manage 10x more workloads with the same headcount through its intelligent automation	- Cloud readiness. Reducing cloud costs and budget overrun | Visibility into existing cloud-based workloads | Planning and/or modeling cloud migration | Enforcing cloud cost governance and budget adherence.
 Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks for my team and I to provide a platform introduction and discuss how we can alleviate the challenges you referred to above? I am confident you will find it valuable.  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
