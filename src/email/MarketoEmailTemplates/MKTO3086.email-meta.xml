    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


We wanted to personally thank you for joining the Turbonomic, Kovarus and Cisco teams on Tuesday evening at AT&amp;T Park! We had a great time getting to know you, with the added benefit of a Giants win, and we hope you did too!
If there is any help that we can provide to you here at Turbonomic, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly, or Michael Goudie &lt;[[mailto:mgoudie@kovarus.com]]&gt; at Kovarus.

On behalf of Turbonomic, Kovarus and Cisco - thank you!


We hope to see you again soon!
Catherine
