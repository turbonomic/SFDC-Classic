Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

Time for your Oracle/Microsoft/IBM/VMware/Vendor X Audit!

Just kidding. But we are here to help safeguard you against your next one. 

67.4% of SysAdmins report that Visibility into License Consumption AND License Policy Management are their greatest challenge in maintaining license compliance*.

Who can blame them? Most licensing models are still based on the old principles of licensing, forcing you to choose between the inefficiencies of physical infrastructure and the compliance risks of virtualization. Once virtualized, software license management can be a nightmare.

 That’s why we’re offering you a FREE 1-hour license gut-check. We’ll show you just how much you could be saving on application, database, and hypervisor spend from the above vendors and more. Click below to get started.
