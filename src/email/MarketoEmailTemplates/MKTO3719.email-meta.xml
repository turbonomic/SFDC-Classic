Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

What is the most cost-effective choice for your applications: AWS or Azure? This should be a straightforward question but for too many IT teams it isn&apos;t. The wrong choice can cost your company millions in unnecessary cloud spend. We can help you make sure that doesn&apos;t happen.

In a recent blog post &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/choosing-between-aws-and-azure/]]&gt;, our Cloud CTO, Mor Cohen, discusses how Turbonomic can identify the right cloud for you and your company in a matter of days.

We hope you find it helpful!
Regards,
