I wanted to circle back and see if now would be a better time to provide the introduction to Turbonomic. Last time we spoke you mentioned that you had a storage implementation project going on and the timing was off but was hoping now would be a better time to sink up. Below are some brief details as to how our customers see value just a quick reminder:  ·         Alleviating constrained resources – preventing the risk of slowness for each application all in real time. ·         Realize the true capacity of the underlying infrastructure allowing you to defer hardware out of the infrastructure. ·         Creating proper capacity planning scenarios within the environment so that you and the team can onboard workloads properly, as well as not over spend on hardware.  Do you have any time over the next few weeks for a brief introduction to Turbonomic?

Turbonomic’s control platform helps customers increase application performance by 37% on 30% less infrastructure.
