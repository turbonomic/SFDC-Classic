    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Will you be joining us at Cisco Live! 2018 next week? We hope you will stop by and visit us at booth #1243. We would love to have the opportunity to connect with you in person.


There will be plenty of chances to see a demo of our latest technology, speak with our executive team and enter to win a Sonos One speaker or Amazon gift card!


If you’d like to schedule a separate, one on one meeting with a member of our executive team outside of the booth, please reach out to events@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:events@turbonomic.com]]&gt;.


See you next week in Orlando!



Regards,
Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
