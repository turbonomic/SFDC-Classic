    <subject>Getting To The Desired State: 2 Facts, 1 Myth, &amp; 1 Challenge</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{Lead.First Name}},

You’re using VMTurbo. Maybe you’re reading the blog. You definitely checked out the website. And, hopefully, you’ve joined the Green Circle Community. Without fail, the Desired State keeps coming up. But what is it really? And why does it matter? 

Understanding fact from myth brings you one step closer to realizing the true potential of VMTurbo:
Fact: The Desired State is when application performance is assured while infrastructure utilization is maximized. 

Your environment is only in its Desired State when you are simultaneously assuring performance and efficiency. Assuring performance when you’re not maximizing efficiency? That’s overprovisioning. Maximizing efficiency, but letting performance slack? That’s under provisioning.  

Fact: The Desired State is constantly changing. 

The inherent nature of a shared environment means that every action causes a reaction and the environment constantly changes as a result. Every decision about application workload demand—what to place where, when, and in what order—impacts every other entity and resource in the data center. It’s complex, it’s dynamic and it’s way beyond human scale. 

Myth: You can define the Desired State. 

Wrong. You can’t define the Desired State—because it’s always changing. It’s not about defining it, it’s about keeping application performance humming along while maximizing utilization of your infrastructure

In the Green Circle, you&apos;ll earn points for every action you take. Blogging, commenting, voting, and breathing. You can then use these points to get cool stuff like T-shirts and headphones!

So what are you waiting for? Talk. Get points. Get Stuff. Because everyone needs more stuff, except for latency and poor application performance, of course.
