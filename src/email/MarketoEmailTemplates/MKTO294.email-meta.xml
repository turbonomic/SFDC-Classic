    <subject>Follow up to NetApp Insight: VMTurbo Cluster Mode Support</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We hope that you found  NetApp Insight to be a valuable event. We enjoyed being part of it for  the first time this year, having announced our collaboration with NetApp  last week whereby VMTurbo will support clustered Data ONTAP 8.2. 

For  more details on cluster-mode support, check out this short article  &lt;http://bit.ly/175diSJ&gt;, which explains how NetApp customers  benefit from the following features of cluster mode support:


 - Maps end-to-end relationships from VMs to Vservers and associated volumes, aggregates and controllers
 - Enables controlling (or recommending) movement of volumes across aggregates
 - Enhances storage efficiency and performance across the clustered deployment



We look forward to staying in touch with you. Please feel free to contact us anytime. 

Sincerely,
The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
