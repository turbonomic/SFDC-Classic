HiÂ {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Not long ago we asked IT professionals, how are you fighting latency? What began as an investigation into understanding common latency measurement and mitigation practices rapidly extended into the implementation of containers and microservices, introducing entirely new latency challenges themselves.
At the end of the survey, we compile responses from more than 550 Enterprise IT and Data Center professionals. The results are rather eye opening!
Key findings include:


	- 91% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the minimization of latency is important to their company, with 23% of respondents identifying a clear majority of hosted workloads (between 60 percent and 100 percent of workloads) as Latency-Critical.
	- 32% of respondents either do not measure latency or do not know if their company measures latency


This is just the tip of the iceberg, if you want to learn more about how the IT industry is fighting latency click below!
