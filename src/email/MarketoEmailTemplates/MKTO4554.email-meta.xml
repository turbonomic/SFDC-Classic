Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
I wanted to make sure you didn&apos;t miss out, this is your last call to join more that 1,000 IT professionals for tomorrow&apos;s webinar at 11am ET, when Eric Wright, Director of Technical Marketing, will weigh the key differences between AWS and Azure.

During the webinar, AWS vs Azure &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-aws-vs-azure/]]&gt;, you will hear real anecdotes of how other organizations have chosen between cloud providers and learn how to decide which cloud is right for your environment.
