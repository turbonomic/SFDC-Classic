The reason that I feel this would be compelling for you is because of the recent plan made to move workloads from your on-premises infrastructure to AWS.  Turbonomic helped Shutterstock:-          Realize savings of $6,000/month for just 51 workloads they were planning to move ($72,000 per year) -          Showed that by rightsizing 73 existing cloud workloads they could save $9,000/month. ($108,000 per year). 124 oversized workloads would have cost them $180K more than necessary. That is an average of $1,452/workload in savings per year.  Even if you only realized half of the savings that Shutterstock realized (so $726/workload), if you lifted and shifted 1000 workloads (1/5 of the workloads on premises today) you would save $726K on AWS expenses just by choosing accurate template sizes as you moved to AWS.  Would you be available for half an hour sometime during the week of the 22nd? I am confident that this conversation would not be a waste of anyone’s time.  Thanks,Maggie From: Margaret Schroeder

Would you be open to a conversation with Gary Reiner, former GE CIO and member of the Board of Directors at Turbonomic? I would love to align you with Gary to discuss IT innovation in the tech industry and what we’re doing to shake things up. Best,Maggie  From: Margaret Schroeder

Subject: Clark Palmer- executive meeting request with Gary Reiner, former CIO of GE Hi Clark,  I am ecstatic to extend an exclusive invitation to meet with former GE SVP &amp; CIO (15 yrs), Gary Reiner (linkedin &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg64489CW64k8B48p-YpCW1pNgV-56dCG-f2BGZDK02?t=&amp;si=6523056037822464&amp;pi=fcfe1423-3a5d-4fe1-857f-05cf6dcfb9a9]]&gt;). I was compelled to connect the two of you as Gary has been meeting with Enterprise CIO’s across the country and the reviews have been outstanding.  I also understand that MeteorComm has a plan to lift and shift your production workloads into AWS in the near future as well, which we have noticed is a major trend and many customers (like BMC &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_IGHTGVR6U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;utm_content=Oktopost-007xsnrlpzujk0y&amp;utm_campaign=video-customer-success-bmc&amp;utm_term=Turbonomic+%28Company%29]]&gt;) have trusted Turbonomic in this critical transition period.  In a brief call you could hear why Gary and General Atlantic announced &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg64489CW64k8B48p-YpCW1pNgV-56dCG-f2BGZDK02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fturbonomic.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fformer-ge-cio-gary-reiner-joins-turbonomic-board%2F&amp;si=6523056037822464&amp;pi=fcfe1423-3a5d-4fe1-857f-05cf6dcfb9a9]]&gt; their $50 million in additional funding towards Turbonomic which has now helped more than 1,600 CIO’s in ensuring maximum performance, efficiency, and resiliency in their hybrid clouds and data centers (ie. Verizon, AT&amp;T, and TDS Telecom). Both the fundraising and growth of Turbonomic’s Board were profiled in Forbes &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg64489CW64k8B48p-YpCW1pNgV-56dCG-f2BGZDK02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Falexkonrad%2F2017%2F01%2F23%2Fturbonomic-raises-50-mil-from-general-atlantic%2F&amp;si=6523056037822464&amp;pi=fcfe1423-3a5d-4fe1-857f-05cf6dcfb9a9]]&gt;. When would be the best time to schedule a 30 minute conversation? Best Regards,Maggie Margaret Schroeder - Turbonomic
