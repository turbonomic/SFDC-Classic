Subject: Demand Driven Control: Turbonomic  Hi Nelson, I wanted to reach out to introduce you to Turbonomic. I know we have connected in the past but here is a reminder of what we do and how we can provide value to Welch’s : Customer’s (Verizon &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen30.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs65jv6bN64zKlFd78r-W8q-c7s56dTTmf1ZF1Jg02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fvmturbo.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fverizon-vmturbo-develop-intelligent-cloud-control%2F&amp;si=5574151980449792&amp;pi=0c30ddb4-e4bb-4ddf-900a-63ecc5169533]]&gt;, IBM, HP, Cisco, CenturyLink &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen30.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs65jv6bN64zKlFd78r-W8q-c7s56dTTmf1ZF1Jg02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vmturbo.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F07%2FVMTurbo-CenturyLink-Success-Story.pdf&amp;si=5574151980449792&amp;pi=0c30ddb4-e4bb-4ddf-900a-63ecc5169533]]&gt;, BT Global &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen30.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs65jv6bN64zKlFd78r-W8q-c7s56dTTmf1ZF1Jg02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vmturbo.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F04%2FVMTurbo-BT-Success-Story.pdf&amp;si=5574151980449792&amp;pi=0c30ddb4-e4bb-4ddf-900a-63ecc5169533]]&gt;,  JP Morgan Chase &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen30.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs65jv6bN64zKlFd78r-W8q-c7s56dTTmf1ZF1Jg02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fvmturbo.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fjpmorgan-chase-inducts-vmturbo-into-hall-of-innovation%2F&amp;si=5574151980449792&amp;pi=0c30ddb4-e4bb-4ddf-900a-63ecc5169533]]&gt;) find our platform to be an excellent fit for their organization. I’m very confident that we can provide the same benefit to Welch’s.  Conventional wisdom has said that IT Operations needs more monitoring, smarter alerts and more data to help assure application performance—the problem is that it only makes IT faster at responding to issues, it’ doesn’t prevent them. It’s still a manual process to do root-cause analysis. Our core business value is that we are able to identify performance risk and provide proactive, actionable recommendations (not more alerts) which can be automated to fix problems initially and then prevent performance issues from happening.  Turbonomic dynamically allocates resources based on what your applications demand, at any given time— not more, not less. This could help your team better support the business as it will make sure that mission critical applications get the resources that they need, when they need them— but not by over provisioning and being inefficient.  Do you have 5 minutes this week to discuss our software?  Best,Kathleen Norchi440-708-8477</textOnly>
