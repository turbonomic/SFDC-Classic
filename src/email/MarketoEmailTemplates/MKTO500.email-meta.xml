    <textOnly>{{lead.first name:default=FACT}}:

VMware&apos;s vCloud Director packs tremendous potential for Service Providers and Enterprises, like {{company.Company Name:default=yours}}, to deliver agile and cost-effective Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). This whitepaper addresses the cost benefits of vCloud deployment, and offers one major way in which you can favorably bend the cost curve 30% more &lt;http://bit.ly/PkufRs&gt;, while:

- Driving efficiency far above traditional DRS
- Eliminating non-productive IT labor costs
- Optimizing costs with multi-tenant reporting
- Positioning for infinite IaaS scalability

As Bernd Herzog of The Virtualization Practice put it, &quot;VMTurbo is delivering today, what is promised in VMwareâ€™s future strategy.&quot; Download the whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/PkufRs&gt;, and learn precisely what this means.

Ahead of the curve,
