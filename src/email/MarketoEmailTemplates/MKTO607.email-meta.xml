Adam Smith is the Father of Modern Economics. In his 1776 Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Smith pondered the omnipotent &quot;Invisible Hand of the Market&quot;, which drives Supply and Demand to dynamic equilibrium. In 2009, we founded VMTurbo on a similar notion: the Invisible Hand of the Data Center. We haven&apos;t looked back since. Thanks, Smitty.
