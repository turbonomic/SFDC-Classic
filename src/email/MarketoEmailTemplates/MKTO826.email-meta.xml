Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for stopping by our booth at VMworld last week.

Events are a lot of fun, though it can be difficult to obtain the comprehensive information you seek among the large number of exhibitors, vendors, and partners, and you’re likely receiving a slew of vendor emails right now. 

So here’s why you spend a few more minutes with this one. 

VMTurbo Operations Manager goes beyond monitoring and reporting on the state of your virtual environment. It displays recommended actions you can take to maintain optimal operating conditions, and can be configured to automatically perform the actions it prescribes—preventing contention and problems from occurring.

We’d like to offer you this complimentary whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/17BRGbY&gt; that will explain in greater detail how you can get the most value from your vCloud Director investment and reduce the cost of compute resources. 

But the best way to see how fast VMTurbo delivers value is to give us a try in your environment. Download this free trial &lt;http://bit.ly/17ozTCH&gt; of our product to get started. 

Sincerely,

VMTurbo VMworld 2013 Team</textOnly>
