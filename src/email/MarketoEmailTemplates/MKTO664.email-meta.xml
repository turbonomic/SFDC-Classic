Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Things change. Take continental drift for example. In a virtual datacenter, things change fast, and we&apos;ve built VMTurbo Operations Manager to not only Converge and Control your environment moment-to-moment, but also to Plan &lt;http://bit.ly/Nfc2mS&gt; for hypothetical changes that have yet to occur.

What would a server or storage hardware refresh do? What if you merged clusters or consolidated data centers? What if a polar bear swims to the mainland? VMTurbo&apos;s advanced planning functionality &lt;http://bit.ly/Nfc2mS&gt; handles all this and more.

Planning a hardware purchase to accommodate growth? VMTurbo calculates exactly the hardware you need - or may well forecast that you don&apos;t need to buy more blades for another year.

Questions? Let&apos;s plan a free assessment &lt;http://bit.ly/1gzh9Hf&gt;.
