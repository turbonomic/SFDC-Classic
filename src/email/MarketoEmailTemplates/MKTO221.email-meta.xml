    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

How much time and money are you already throwing at your virtualization storage problem? And is this stalling your virtual datacenter expansion initiatives? 

Next week, VMTurbo will unveil new features - including added support for additional layers of the IT stack, such as data storage - that improve performance and  reduce infrastructure cost across the virtual datacenter.

You won’t want to miss this opportunity to learn first-hand from VMTurbo experts how to automate decision-making to bring control to what can be a chaotic environment.
