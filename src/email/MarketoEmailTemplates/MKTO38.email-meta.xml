Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We&apos;re sorry to have missed you at the VMTurbo webcast on September 25, 2012.  But, hey, things come up, right? The good news is that we recorded the session and are offering a playback &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-om3bI1dhmk&amp;feature=youtu.be&gt;.

Our presentation focused on current and new features in VMTurbo Operations Manager. Version 3.2 &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/press-releases/new-vmturbo-release-enables-intelligent-onboarding-and-automated-control-for-cloud-infrastructures/&gt; addresses the growing demand for greater intelligence, agility and automation in onboarding application workloads to private, public and hybrid clouds, as well as providing holistic and granular control for distributed multi-site operations. This release also extends discovery and application-aware management to Java applications and Linux environments, and adds hypervisor support for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 3.0.

For those of you not already using Operations Manager, you can download a trial &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/cloud-edition-download.html&gt; and visit our Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/eval-tutorial-discover/&gt; to learn more.  If you&apos;re a current customer and you&apos;re interested in updating your current version to the latest revision, you can update online right from the Admin Tab in Operations Manager or follow the instructions  &lt;http://support.vmturbo.com/entries/21378687-vmturbo-operations-manager-current-release-offline-update&gt;on our support site for an offline update.
