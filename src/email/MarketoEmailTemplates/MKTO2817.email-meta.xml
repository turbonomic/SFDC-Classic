    <subject>Webinar: TESM and Turbonomic</subject>
    <textOnly>Join TESM&apos;s webinar on Thursday, 6th July at 11.30 (BST).
TESM and Turbonomic will show you how ServiceNow ITSM solutions and hybrid cloud management, can be brought together to help you in the multi-dimensional challenge of aligning business demand with IT supply:


	- How do you assure application performance while remaining efficient and cost-effective?
	- How do you continue to comply with appropriate regulatory and other policy requirements?
	- How do you embrace the agility, elasticity, flexibility and responsiveness that the cloud offers, without compromising your ITSM governance processes and controls?


We hope you will be able to join us to find some answers to these challenges.
The session will be presented by TESM Strategic Consultant, Stuart Hasking &lt;[[http://mail.tesm.com/t/i-i-olrjrkt-idkhuyddt-y/]]&gt;, and Anson McCook &lt;[[http://mail.tesm.com/t/i-i-olrjrkt-idkhuyddt-j/]]&gt;, Senior Manager, Sales Engineering, Turbonomic.
