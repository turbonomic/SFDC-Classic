    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

It was great to see you at AWS Re:Invent last week!

If you stopped by our booth we hope you enjoyed the conversations with our team on how Turbonomic can run in your AWS environment as well as your on-premises infrastructure (or any other public clouds) and continuously analyzes workload consumption, cost, and compliance constraints to automatically adjust resources in real-time. 

If you need a refresher, we&apos;ve put together this data sheet &lt;[[https://cdn.turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-for-AWS-Data-Sheet.pdf]]&gt; to summarize the value that Turbonomic can provide.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/company/contact-us/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email]]&gt; to the team and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
