Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Thereâ€™s only three weeks left until the Greatest Spectacle in Racing, and we want to send you and a friend to the 101st Running of the Indy 500 on May 28th &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CKCKTV8?marketo_zs00ja7e8g=%5bmarketo_zs00ja7e8g_value%5d&amp;marketo_ff0s7l5qls=%5bmarketo_ff0s7l5qls_value%5d&amp;marketo_olh86f3r9s=%5bmarketo_olh86f3r9s_value%5d&amp;marketo_day0sfb59s=%5bmarketo_day0sfb59s_value%5d&amp;marketo_qqebotxyuo=%5bmark]]&gt;!
Turbonomic is giving away 10 pairs of (2) Reserved Seating tickets to the first ten people to schedule a 30-minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer. And after those tickets are gone, we will continue to give a pair of (2) General Admission tickets to everyone that schedules a meeting. That means, everyone is a winner!
The giveaway ends on May 15th, and the tickets are going fast. Make sure you schedule your meeting today &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CKCKTV8?marketo_zs00ja7e8g=%5bmarketo_zs00ja7e8g_value%5d&amp;marketo_ff0s7l5qls=%5bmarketo_ff0s7l5qls_value%5d&amp;marketo_olh86f3r9s=%5bmarketo_olh86f3r9s_value%5d&amp;marketo_day0sfb59s=%5bmarketo_day0sfb59s_value%5d&amp;marketo_qqebotxyuo=%5bmark]]&gt;!
Best,
