Do you have 30 minutes to an hour to jump on an introductory call with an engineer and I the first couple of weeks of July? Best regards.   James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;</textOnly>
