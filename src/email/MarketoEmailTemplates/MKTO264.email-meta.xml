Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for joining us at our VMworld VIP Cocktail Reception at Twenty Five Lusk last week.  We enjoyed mingling with you and your peers and discussing how your business and IT goals would advance with full datacenter control.

In follow up, we invite you to download this free trial &lt;http://bit.ly/17ozTCH&gt; of our product so you can see what software-defined control looks like in your own environment. 

Also, feel free to check out this complimentary whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/17BRGbY&gt; that will explain how you can get the most value from your vCloud Director investment and reduce the cost of compute resources.

Sincerely,

VMTurbo VMworld 2013 Team</textOnly>
