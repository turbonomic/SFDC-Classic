	- Reduce ongoing compute/storage costs by 20-30% by optimizing workload placement as they shift workloads to a new hypervisor technology	- Reduce operational costs of problem and incident management by eliminating complex problems with disk space and IO performance contention	- Assure application performance and reduce risk by minimizing the contention for CPU, Mem, disk space and IO capacity	- Enable more IO-intensive applications to be virtualized reliably, bringing down the overall cost to deliver compute services to the business and customer
We do all of this with no human intervention through our workload automation engine. Do you have 30 minutes for my engineer and I to explain how this is possible on a 30 minute WebEx?  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
