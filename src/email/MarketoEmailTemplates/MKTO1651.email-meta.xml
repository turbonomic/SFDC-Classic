Hi {{lead.First Name:default=}},

This past July we conducted a survey titled How Are You Fighting Latency? 554 Enterprise IT and Data Center professionals completed the survey and the results are finally in!

The survey explored the methods organizations used to mitigate latency, container and microservices adoption as well as the reasons for adoption and barriers to entry for both.

Some of the key findings include:


 - 91% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the minimization of latency is important to their company, with 23% of respondents identifying a clear majority of hosted workloads (between 60 percent and 100 percent of workloads) as being Latency-Critical.
 - 32% of respondents either do not measure latency or do not know if their company measures latency


This is just the tip of the iceberg, if you want to learn more about how the IT industry is fighting latency click below!
