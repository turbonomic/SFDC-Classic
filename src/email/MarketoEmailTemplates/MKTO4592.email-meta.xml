Simplify VDI
{{lead.First Name:default=FACT}}:

46% of VDI projects are halted due to cost and performance issues, but the advantages of successful VDI deployment are undeniable:


 - Centralized management and maintenance
 - Lower operational costs
 - Increased security
 - Flexibility
 - Economies of scale across each of the above


VMTurbo’s Assuring Performance in VDI Deployments &lt;http://bit.ly/1be0NGh&gt; whitepaper addresses the inherent complexities of VDI initiatives, and how your organization can guarantee performance, efficiency, and positive end user experience just like Aetna Insurance &lt;http://ubm.io/1gGvrKZ&gt; recently did.

It’s a new era in VDI management.
In good health,
VMTurbo
