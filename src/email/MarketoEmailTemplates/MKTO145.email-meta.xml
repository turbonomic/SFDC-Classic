    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

The successes we’ve seen with our customers’ implementations of VMTurbo Operations Manager have been stellar, contributing to huge efficiency gains in time and costs. Our successes &lt;http://bit.ly/101v6ZT&gt; in 2012 are pretty exciting as well—and we’ve kicked off 2013 with a new product revision &lt;http://bit.ly/12IPhNr&gt; and being named to Forbes’ list &lt;http://bit.ly/12vYR6c&gt; of America’s Most Promising Companies.

As it’s been a while since we caught you up on VMTurbo news, we’d like to invite you to attend our quarterly briefing &lt;http://bit.ly/YTGq4F&gt; for industry influencers on Tuesday, March 5th at 12:00 pm ET.  Why should you attend? We’re really keen to start a dialog with you—share what we are doing now and in the near future, 
and get your feedback regarding how we extend our product into the fabric and storage layers of the infrastructure, either during the briefing or separately afterward.

At VMTurbo, it’s our belief that IT operations management needs to be fundamentally changed &lt;http://bit.ly/126IaiC&gt; to allow companies to unlock the full value of virtualized infrastructure and cloud services. As virtualization and cloud adoption grows, these complex environments require a new approach to controlling the infrastructure and maintaining the desired state—one that offloads and automates decision-making instead of just providing alerts. Our founder and CTO Shmuel Kliger and co-founder and VP of product strategy Yuri Rabover will provide an overview of our Software-Defined Control system that delivers on this new approach.

We hope you will join us and are looking forward to starting, and continuing, our dialog with you.  Please register now &lt;http://bit.ly/YTGq4F&gt;.

Best regards,

Lauren Whitehouse
