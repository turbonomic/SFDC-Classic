Intro title:

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

It’s been a busy summer here at VMTurbo and we wanted to take a moment to make sure you were aware of some new content and tools that are FREE for all of our community members.


 - We recently launched our new website – with several new best practice whitepapers in our resource section. New Website: http://bit.ly/Nn9JJc 

 - Our 3.1 version of Operations Manager is available for download. The only UNLIMITED free product on the market for vSphere, Hyper-V and XenServer environments. Download the virtual appliance and start preventing problems (instead of drilling through data) in less than 30 minutes. Download now: http://bit.ly/R2TvIO 

- If you just have a few minutes (2:31 to be exact), check out our new animated video describing  how our technology delivers a smarter way to control cloud and virtualized environments. See video: http://bit.ly/RRD164 


Hope to see you at VMworld (Booth #2222) later this month.

 Thanks,

 Derek Slayton
