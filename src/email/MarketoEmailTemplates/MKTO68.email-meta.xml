    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

As we close in on the end of a successful year here at VMTurbo, I wanted to take the opportunity to reach out to thank you for your business and give you an update on where we are as a company. I also want to make you aware of a program we are launching exclusively to our existing customer base.

First off, thanks to great customers like yourself, we rocketed through the 200th customer plateau earlier this year and are well on our way to more than 250 by the end of the year. One of the big efforts we’ve had is working with our customer base to capture some of their experiences with our product in success stories like the one here &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/resources/case-studies/&gt; from the London School of Economics. Many of our customers are using VMTurbo to really push the limits of the use of virtualization across their data center environments. Folks like the Mayo Clinic who are more than 95% virtualized and using our solution to control resource allocation and assure performance across 3,000 VMs in their production environment and also more than 4,000 virtual desktop images for their clinical devices.

Is your virtual environment growing? If it is, we want to work with you on helping you plan for accommodating this growth – something our product is uniquely capable of doing. If you are adding new hosts to your virtual estate or considering rolling out your use of VMTurbo in other environments, we have some incentives in place to help you do that before the end of year. The team here will be following up with you shortly to better understand your needs. Of course, if I can answer any questions or help in any way, don’t hesitate to contact me directly.

Thanks again for your partnership with us as a VMTurbo customer. We remain committed to ensuring your success with our product and driving improved efficiency and control across your virtual data centers.

Best Regards, 

N. Louis Shipley
