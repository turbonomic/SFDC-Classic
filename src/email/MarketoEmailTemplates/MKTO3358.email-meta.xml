Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
We are very excited to introduce our new live streaming event series, C:IO Labs! Join us as we bridge the business and technology gap. We’ll focus on the promising technologies enterprises are adopting or experimenting with today—the dream, the reality, when are they right for you (and when they’re not), and how to be successful with them.
Every quarter different members of our Engineering leadership will respond to your questions live, keeping you up to date on the latest trends and technology in our industry.
Join us this month, Wednesday, March 23rd for a live streamed interview of VMTurbo CTO, Charles Crouchman. We’ll focus on Enterprise Private Cloud—the good, the bad…the dream—and take questions online. The conversation is what you make it!
