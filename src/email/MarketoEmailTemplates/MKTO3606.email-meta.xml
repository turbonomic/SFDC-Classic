    <subject>Choosing Between AWS and Azure? Learn How Turbonomic Saves Our Customers Millions</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/choosing-between-aws-and-azure-webinar/]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

A few weeks ago, we were brought in to help a customer who was struggling to figure out whether to choose AWS or Azure.

Their initial preference was for AWS, but they had a lot of Microsoft licenses and wanted to consider Azure as well. They had taken months to build dozens of spreadsheets and financial models, but were still unable to get a clear picture of what the true cloud costs for their specific applications would be.

In just five days, Turbonomic Cloud Migration Planning provided them with clear, data-driven recommendations that enabled them to answer the “AWS or Azure” question definitively – and saved the company millions of dollars annually in the process.

To learn how you can choose the best cloud for your applications, register for our upcoming Live Webinar scheduled for Thursday, April 26th at 11am ET.

Once you register for the webinar, check out the blog post we just published &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/choosing-between-aws-and-azure/]]&gt; on this very topic.

We look forward to seeing you on the webinar!
