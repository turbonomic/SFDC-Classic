Subject: Turbonomic info Leo-I wanted to reach out to introduce myself and Turbonomic and how our control solution has been enabling busniesses like Verizon, Cisco, HP and BMC to be more performant, efficient and agile with their virtual and cloud infrastructures.  To give you some context, Turbonomic is an application performance control system that matches infrastructure supply to workload demand continuously and in real time, through automatic workload placement and rightsizing decisions that take into account a) the underlying capacity of your infrastructure and b) the ‘ripple effect’ of every single decision point. In doing so, our solution fills the gaps in the hypervisor and monitoring tools to meet the goal of real-time performance assurance and maximum resource utilization simultaneously, without human analysis or intervention.  Turbonomic is also enabling customers to support and safely migrate across multi hypervisor environments (VMWare, Openstack etc) and new PaaS technologies, Containers, and Cloud Enablement.   Some Key value points of the Turbonomic solution
	- Turbonomic sits on top of your virtualization platform (VMWare, HyperV, OpenStack, etc) It automates the workload placement, sizing, and capacity decisions for you to improve performance and drive efficiency of your cloud infrastructure. 	- Hybrid Cloud Management- Turbonomic intelligently determines which workloads to burst where and when to assure performance and maximize efficiency 	- Increase density by 20%-40% with intelligent placement actions (better utilization of existing infrastructure to lower CapX &amp; OppX)	- Reduce and control software licensing (CapX &amp; OppX savings)	- Accurately plan for the future and understand when you need to buy new hardware and where you need to put it.	- Turbonomic installs in under an hour and will be providing immediate value within the first day.
