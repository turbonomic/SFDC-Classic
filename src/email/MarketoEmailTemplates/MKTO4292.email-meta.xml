    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


I&apos;m reaching out to make sure you have what you need to take full advantage of the new features at your disposal in Turbonomic 6.2. If you haven&apos;t upgraded already, contact your CX rep who would be happy to help you upgrade. In the meantime, check out our live demo &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/on-demand-webinars/live-demo-how-to-unlock-cloud-elasticity-to-lower-cloud-bills?utm_campaign=70157000001bYHwAAM]]&gt; which explores a few key aspects of our latest product release &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/turbonomic-6-2]]&gt; including:



	- Turbonomic scaling in the cloud—6.2 adds enhancements for both AWS and Azure. Determine the right compute &amp; storage templates for your workload.
	- Percentile scaling—Push the bounds of cost optimization in the cloud by telling Turbo to be more conservative or aggressive with its scaling recommendations.
	- Time scaling—Adjust the timeframe at which Turbonomic observes peaks to best fit your business needs.
