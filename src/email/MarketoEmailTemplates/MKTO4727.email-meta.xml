As organizations develop a next-generation cloud strategy, they are faced with a multitude of architectural options across sites: private cloud, public cloud, IaaS, PaaS, virtualization and more. Across these options, how do you guarantee performance? How do you guarantee resilience? How do you procure exactly the resources you need? How do you construct an elusive, scalable-on-demand hybrid cloud? 

Attend this event to learn which Cloud deployment is best for your business, and more importantly, how to deploy, optimize and manage it for maximum performance and resiliency and recoverability.Â 

As space is limited, please RSVP TODAY &lt;[[https://events.presidio.com/np/clients/presidio/eventRegistration.jsp?event=26414&amp;]]&gt; to reserve your seat!



Sincerely,
 The Turbonomic Team</textOnly>
