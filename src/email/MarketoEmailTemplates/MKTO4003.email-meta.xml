    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Will you be attending Microsoft Inspire next week? If you are, we hope that you will stop by and visit Turbonomic in Booth #1422.

Turbonomic has been named by Microsoft as a top ISV for assessment, migration, and optimization of hybrid cloud environments.

Our API driven platform assesses and optimizes hybrid cloud environments pre-migration, radically accelerates Azure migrations with fast and accurate plans and once in Azure, enables customers to continuously optimize their entire hybrid state - assuring the performance of their applications at the lowest possible cost.

Our executive team will be in Las Vegas for Microsoft Inspire and would love to meet. Click here to schedule a one-on-one meeting &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-meeting-microsoft-inspire/]]&gt; with a member of our team at Inspire.


We hope to see you next week!


Regards,
Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
