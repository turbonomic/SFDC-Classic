    <subject>Stop Fire Fighting - Make Better Use of Your Team’s Time</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

You’re busy – fighting fires and chasing down issues consumes too much of your team’s time and focus – and it’s becoming more complex as you expand virtualization and adopt cloud services.

Rather than seeking a faster way to put out the fires, why not strive to maintain your systems and applications in a healthy state, thus preventing issues from igniting in the first place? 
 
We have a better approach to control your virtualized environment. It’s being used by hundreds of other organizations like BT, Colgate-Palmolive, and London School of Economics to drive down costs, improve virtual workload performance and maximize resource utilization. Our Software-Defined Control system can automate the decision-making process for your IT ops team and provides intelligent actions that maintain your virtual environment in a healthy state. 
 
But don’t just take our word for it. Check out this short overview &lt;http://bit.ly/10cctnM&gt; to learn how VMTurbo can help you manage the challenges brought about by virtualization. Find out how easy it can be to gain control – and put down the fire hose.

Best Regards,
