With the 5.9 release, Turbonomic can help you break down which templates are the most cost effective for spinning up workloads in a public cloud like AWS or Azure.  Our customers use the automation to not only increase workload performance, but to also increase the efficiency of their infrastructure. Because of this they are able to spend significantly less on hardware year over year.  BMC CIO, Scott Crowder Talks Turbonomic - Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; From what I know about the complexity of SFWMD’s infrastructure, I am confident you will find our product valuable.

Subject: Turbo 5.9 Release and Controlling Cloud Costs  Duane - Unfortunately, my team and I have never gotten the chance to introduce Turbonomic to you and the team at SFWMD. I was hoping that with the new additional capabilities in the 5.9 release there would be some interest in seeing how Turbonomic can provide value to you and your team.  Typically our customers face visibility challenges when moving to the public cloud,  only having in-region visibility, have difficulty correlating a VM to the resources it consume and the cost for the resources are not visible ANYWHERE.  Because AWS has 16 regions, 70 templates or so on each and 7 storage options &gt; 7,000 options and Azure has 29 regions, 40 template on each and 4 storage options &gt; 4,000 options it can be very challenging to choose the right template and the right region for every migrated workload out of the available options. Turbonomic’s 5.9 answers all of the questions for you and your team and can give:  •       Accurate demand-based instance decision, based on real-time and historical full stack visibility•       Avoid the high costs of allocation-based overprovisioning •       Full stack visibility from a simple non-intrusive discovery process•       Accelerate hardware decommissioning by optimizing your on-prem environment during migration•       Accelerate Cloud Migration/Adoption•       Real-Time performance actions•       Rightsizing for performance (within and across instance families)•       Pre-paid capacity recommendations  5.9 Webinar Release &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jE1ZcMDLKlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhNDlWgQS%5F3oKLVY4FHdKZg38lu8KS2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXY5wghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYew8UmUz0z85jbcGGVc%5Fu%2DWw0iSKJ1hoeRR628QwUkKStL6zgHmkYUviHYBwsEmty8%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DPOQbxDmgk21YUPMefBidnxhxnT4j25oM96%5FahQa3RijpMgaumyev2za5C7AA5VKHsvga8yneEBrD28oweGT8U6uZ6gg%2C/j0lYd8fJLFlNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpxscmlF98fP6CLFT9itxfE587ZqTLTFtdAZVtxQ1LH62CeYJJ9PRPRB6%5FUy%5FAlK7RMt9WRJVY5stC%5FvmX9nBU%5F9TWy0XNJU42SH1mQDWcU6onkBHJKLcxUQ%5FU%2DVH0Jp4KqQ8hhLEx0df4Wfbn3w%2C%2C]]&gt;  We do all of this while optimizing your on-premise infrastructure through our workload automation.
