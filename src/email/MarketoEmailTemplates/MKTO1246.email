<body ><div ><div class="mktEditable" id="edit_text_1" >Ben,<br /><br />Mark Cuban here from the Mavs. Heard about your hybrid cloud idea from my friend Sam Watkinson. LOVE IT! Lets get a meeting together, we can skip the shark tank audition Kevin and Rob are a waste of time anyways.<br /><br />I've got 3 tickets set up for you Sam and your colleague Justin to come to Dallas and sit courtside at a Mavs game. I won't be able to join you at the game but at half time you can come up to my private box suite and we can talk.<br /><br />Looking forward to the ideas!<br /><br />Mark<br /><br />Mark Cuban<br />President, Dallas Mavericks
