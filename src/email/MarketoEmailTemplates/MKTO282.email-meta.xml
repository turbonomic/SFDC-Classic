Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thanks for taking the time to come by and see us at the VMware User Group in Dallas. As a follow-up to the event, I&apos;ve linked below a few of the many resources designed to dive deeper into the ways VMTurbo will dramatically improve how you control and automate your virtual data center.

 - Trial Download &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; - check out VMTurbo in your environment, absolutely free
 - Online Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://bit.ly/Yz66Yv&gt; for product and support info
- Whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/1estnDV&gt; on reducing compute costs in VMware vCloud Director Environments

My team will be following up with you shortly to understand your priorities and interest in learning more about VMTurbo.

Kind regards
