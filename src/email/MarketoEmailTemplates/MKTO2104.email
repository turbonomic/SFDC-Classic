<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I hope this note finds you well! My name is {{company.Account Owner First Name:default=edit me}} and I cover the ***Insert Region*** for Turbonomic. I'm reaching out to see if you would be open to a conversation about how Turbonomic’s technology can help you address some of the problems specific to Financial Services IT professionals.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In the financial services sector, even a few hours of application downtime can cost organizations millions of dollars. Not only is this detrimental to your balance sheet, but to customer experience, which is becoming even more important as expectations rise and competition amongst banks and FinTech organizations increases. Managing this dynamic along with increased scale, security considerations, and new technologies isn’t easy.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I'd love to learn more about your current approach to these challenges, and share how we’ve helped organizations like <strong>Regions Financial and Silicon Valley Bank overcome them.</strong></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Would you be open to a conversation at ***INSERT DATE*** at ***INSERT TIME***or ***INSERT TIME***?
