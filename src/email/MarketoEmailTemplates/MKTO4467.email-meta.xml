Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Gartner predicts that by 2020 organizations that lack cost optimization processes will average 40% overspend in the public cloud. It shouldn&apos;t have to be this way for you and your team.
Join me for the “How to Beat the Cloud Status Quo &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-cloud-status-quo/?utm_campaign=70157000001j596AAA]]&gt;” webinar, where you will learn:


	- How organizations are negatively impacted by the cloud cost break-fix loop

	- The key factors that collectively drive cost optimization in the cloud

	- How to quantifiably improve performance and reduce costs in the cloud


Continuous cost optimization is key to unlocking scalability, agility, and operational efficiency.
