    <subject>Details for Bain Breakfast Tomorrow</subject>
    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=}},
I&apos;m very much looking forward to meeting up tomorrow, and first wanted to provide you with details for breakfast. As a reminder, we&apos;ll begin at 7:30 a.m. You have been pre-cleared with Hancock Tower Security, so you need only present a valid Driver&apos;s License/ID.

We&apos;ll be in the Weather Beacon Conference Room on the 39th Floor, Bain Capital Ventures. Once past security, simply take the elevator to Floor 39, where you&apos;ll be greeted by a VMTurbo team member.

If you have any questions on your way up, please contact VMTurbo&apos;s JR Butler at 774.249.4299.

Looking forward to it,
{{lead.Lead Owner First Name:default=}}
500 Boylston Street, Eighth Floor, Boston, MA 02116 Tel: 866.634.5087
