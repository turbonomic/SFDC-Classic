Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
The future is hybrid. Public clouds serve an increasing number of use cases for enterprises today, both for net-new applications and for migrating some pre-existing workloads. Despite this peaked interest, the enterprise data center remains as a significant technology investment in need of greater automation and efficiency.
Join us tomorrow on August 22 at 11:00AM ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/forrester-turbonomic-hybrid-cloud-webinar/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=forrester_webinar&amp;utm_content=08212017]]&gt; to discuss the keys to successful hybrid management and optimization across your on-premises data center and your public cloud usage.
During this webinar, hear from Forrester Analyst Lauren Nelson, and Turbonomic CTO, Charles Crouchman, as they discuss how to optimize for your hybrid cloud, including:


	- Visibility into your applications to understand the best configurations at any given time
	- Performance analytics to ensure quality experience
	- Cloud cost metrics to avoid overspending
	- Governance to keep compliant
