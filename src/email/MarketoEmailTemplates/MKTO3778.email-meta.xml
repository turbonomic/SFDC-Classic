Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
As you may know, Cisco OEM’s our product and rebranded it as Cisco Workload Optimization Manager (CWOM), which is part of the enterprise cloud suite. Our software, Turbonomic, is used by organizations such as DXC Technologies, Verizon and JP Morgan Chase globally. 
In a nutshell, Turbonomic is a real-time decision engine which instantly scales infrastructure resources up or down, in response to changes in workload demand. It proactively does this, before service levels are affected, thereby preventing issues from occurring in the first place. 
This video &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meyqTUBRsvg&amp;feature=youtu.be]]&gt; illustrates Turbonomic at scale, highlighting some of the benefits. 
Will you be attending Cisco Live? If so, I would love the opportunity to meet with you and your team. Please respond to this email if you are available so we can schedule a time to get together in Orlando. 
Sincerely, 
Steve 

 
 
 Steve Corndell 
 
 GM &amp; VP of Commercial Sales, Turbonomic
