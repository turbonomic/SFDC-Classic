Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Managing Storage performance and availability presents a complex set of challenges for virtualization and storage administrators.  

The challenge is twofold
On one hand, storage I/O problems can manifest themselves for a number of reasons including workloads that generate significant amounts of I/O, traffic creating contention between workloads which share the same storage aggregates. Some areas of the storage infrastructure may have over-allocated IOPS capacity. These issues are made more challenging by the dynamic nature of workloads, which makes it difficult to ensure workload performance.

The other dimension of complexity is that technologies like thin provisioning and de-duplication obscure administrators&apos; visibility into the 
amount of disk space that is available to support existing and new workload demand. 

A new way to manage the complexity
VMTurbo recently created a webinar that explains how IT managers are addressing these issues. Download the webinar &lt;http://bit.ly/18ptRnW&gt; and learn how this new method will allow you to:


 - Get accurate end-to-end visibility of I/O performance and disk space availability across all layers of the stack  
 - Control performance of the environment through intelligent workload placement and a broad set of resource allocation decisions
 - Accurately plan for future workload demand taking into account storage I/O and disk space



Sincerely,

The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
