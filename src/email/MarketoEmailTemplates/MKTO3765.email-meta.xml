Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

This is your last chance! Don&apos;t miss our live webinar on Thursday, June 7 at 2pm GMT.  Join Mor Cohen-Tal, our Cloud CTO, as she discusses Using AI to Continuously Maximize Cloud Cost Savings.
 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/using-ai-to-cut-cloud-costs/]]&gt;

During the webinar, you will learn how to continuously optimize reserved instance utilization in concert with resizing automation – to drive the elasticity AND cost savings you want and expect from the cloud.

Regards, 
Graeme
