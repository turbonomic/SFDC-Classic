I was hoping that you and the team might have some time to over the next few weeks to have a fifteen to thirty minute conversation around Turbonomic’s control platform and how it helps our customers capitalize on the investment they made in virtualization. In short, Turbonomic allows our customers like Southern Baptist Medical Center, and Moffitt Cancer Center (to name local customers) to increase application performance by taking a different approach &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jEtUecbNKlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhNClK5XTnfkKLJbcNBY7M1ychlovjj3XgRuNzfv2jhE0kmbmhVNgqWWYsJ1hD9NMghaCWX%2DFzNPrcXpXgmj7pW7JiNdJ%2DA836N72HSwhK3LWtOtJW03WXoIK1Pye0LjhEezGIqUNT1txvOkqULowto88tNlB49pqVzLe982iukSyCx6JzBHbE6c52AweH%5FlusrYkcjirIDbleDcE%2D1J6TJQC9%2DqCapuAEJOBlaIhhwAesJpB6EilZdQswWTiK9uiEhyV4m44Bvx7D16DqTOin6Bjnf%5FE3tjUk%2C/j0hUeMXOLVlNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwt0x3V19ZqPLMUfpjcFUEoY7ZP2XDgxfTJ1q1DNMFevILph1295nAWKzCRnUlqrwP5QLI5Zq3exg6qKu%2D2Ytj%2D2usQzIMHc3FSNBcS2rXKw5rQjAGZEvagTCqV%2DEZqM%2C]]&gt;, allowing the applications to dictate the resources they need in real time automation. With this, our customers are able to also increase VM to host density, allowing them to spend less on hardware saving them hundreds of thousands.  I was hoping that you might have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks to jump on a conference bridge with one of my engineers and I to learn more about the platform to see if it could be a fit for you and the team at LMRC. Do you have any time over the next few weeks?  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  Going to Cisco Live?
