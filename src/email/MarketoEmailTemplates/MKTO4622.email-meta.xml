    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/vip-st-louis-2019/]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Hybrid or Public Cloud? Which Cloud is Right for You?


Are you tasked with transforming your data center for a Cloud initiative? Trying to choose between hybrid cloud or public cloud? Which is the right cloud feature or service, and which cloud provider should you use? Are you torn among the various technologies and looking for answers? Join us in this informational event to learn of the key services, capabilities, and differences as you look to adopt cloud in your environment.

Youâ€™ll learn about terminology, the compelling reasons behind certain key services, and hear real-life stories of how others have found what they are looking for when choosing among various cloud deployments. You will hear from Oved Lourie, Turbonomic Field CTO, on why certain choices are made, how to map these to your requirements and objectives, and most important of all, how to optimize your cloud once deployed.

Following a brief presentation and lunch, you will have the pleasure of hearing from Orlando Pace. He will discuss his football career at OSU as well as the thirteen seasons he spent in the NFL. Each attendee will walk away with a professional picture taken with Orlando Pace!
