If so, please let me know and I would be happy to arrange a time that is best for you. I promise to respect your time and process for reviewing new platforms if you so choose to agree to an introduction.  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
