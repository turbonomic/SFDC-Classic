I was hoping to discuss with you how our platform Turbonomic allows our customers to continue to scale and grow their business at a low cost, enabling teams to capitalize on the investment they made in virtualization.  Turbonomic is different from the VSuite of tools and does what VMware’s VRops and VSphere &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__vmturbo.wistia.com_medias_r67l1kk7i5&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=U0G0XJAMhEk_X0GAGzCL7Q&amp;r=gCM-eHqoYayWsyj2WpjQpy-xt8VFoVSjREH3qzN_pFc&amp;m=erZ9PuJjze5t-BnkoKw3YD3ubcDm5HdGJRnou-bx7q8&amp;s=53sYZb5wf_W8KiyzTM-PNOLY6alH3VAgam1tf0ILPGA&amp;e=]]&gt; can’t to allow our customers to prevent problems from ever entering their environment.  Typically teams run into three separate questions when continuing to virtualize within their infrastructure:  ·         Are the virtual machines properly sized and placed within the infrastructure so we know the applications are getting the right resources they need in order to run optimally? ·         Do we have enough capacity within our existing infrastructure to onboard X numbers of virtual machines? ·         Are the virtual machines onboard and sized properly? And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications?  Turbonomic answers all these questions for you and your infrastructure team as well as help you plan for any workloads you are looking to onboard to Azure or AWS public cloud. This allows for our customers to increase operational efficiency as alerts decrease by 80% and increase infrastructure efficiency while still assuring application performance. Would you be interested in seeing how this is possible in a 30 minute introduction call? Right now we are also offering a $100 Amazon gift card for a 30 minute meeting. I am confident you will find it valuable.  Best, James </textOnly>
