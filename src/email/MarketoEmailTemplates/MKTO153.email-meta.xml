Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Your team probably has plenty of tools that provide visibility to performance in your virtualized data center. But most of their time, and yours, is spent drilling into data and troubleshooting potential issues (or real ones) – especially as your virtual environment grows.
 
Let’s face it--threshold-based reactions eat up too much of your team’s cycles. There has to be a better way to control the environment and maintain health without all the running around.
 
In less time than it takes to drink a cup of coffee, learn &lt;http://bit.ly/XYnaGJ&gt; about a unique approach that automates decision-making and keeps your environment in the desired state – ensuring workload performance and optimal resource utilization – and avoids all the firefighting.

Thank you,
