Hi {{lead.First Name:default=}},

Despite this projection, few if any organizations have achieved this end state.

This survey will take approximately twelve (12) minutes to complete. For your time, you will be entered for a chance to win one (1) of ten (10) $100 Amazon Gift Cards.* Thank you for your participation.
