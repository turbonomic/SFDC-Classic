 The Wingtip Private Club
 550 Montgomery, 10th Floor
 San Francisco, CA 94108
 Back by popular demand! We are hosting another evening of fun, food, libations, and networking on the top floor of the 
Wingtip Club. This new and uniquely themed venue is a 21st Century interpretation of the classic social club located across the street from the TransAmerica Pyramid on the top floor of 550 Montgomery above the Wingtip retail shop (former Bank of Italy).
Wingtip boasts great views, one of the top spirits collection in San Francisco, and of course you can also expect an extraordinary 
mix of people and a few surprises.
