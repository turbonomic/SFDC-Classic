    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


You’ve likely mastered the basic features of VMTurbo Operations Manager and are seeing performance and efficiency improvements. However, that’s only for the current environment. What happens if you need to increase your workloads using existing assets? What would be impact of a server or storage hardware refresh be? Is there a benefit to merging clusters or consolidating data centers?

The advanced planning features in VMTurbo Operations Manager can deliver the answers to these and other “what if” scenarios. To familiarize yourself with this powerful tool, check out the video on &quot;Projecting Changes&quot; &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/eval-tutorial-plan/&gt;.You can also request a support engineer to demo &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/request-a-demo.html&gt; these features.

If you would like to evaluate the Planning capabilities yourself, please give me a call at {{lead.Lead Owner Phone Number:default=edit me}} so that I may issue you a license to unlock this feature.

Please let us know if you have questions or need assistance by contacting support  &lt;http://support.vmturbo.com/home&gt;… or me.
