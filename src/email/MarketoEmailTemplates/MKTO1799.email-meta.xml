Did you know online shoppers are 40% more likely to leave a web page if it takes longer than 2 seconds to load? B2C companies face the challenge of combating latency and assuring application performance each day. 

Join us this Wednesday at 12:00 PM EDT as we learn how Canon U.S.A. assures performance for business-critical applications, maximizes efficiency and prepares for the holidays!

During the webinar, we’ll cover:


 - Unique challenges e-commerce companies face in combating website latency and assuring performance of applications throughout the year and particularly during the holiday season
 - Challenges presented by a complex and growing infrastructure while remaining conscientious of budgetary constraints
 - How Canon U.S.A. uses VMTurbo to alleviate resource contention, enable greater efficiency and maximize performance in their data centers
 - How VMTurbo enabled Canon U.S.A. to accelerate the virtualization of its data centers 



All attendees will be included in a live drawing for a Canon PowerShot A4000.
- The VMTurbo Team
