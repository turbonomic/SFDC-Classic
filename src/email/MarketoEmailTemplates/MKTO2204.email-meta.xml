My intention was to do the opposite and learn if there is a chance for us to support you and the team at Claire’s.  There was some confusion on the phone as to where Turbonomic can help. We plug in on the hypervisor level and the reason we are partnered with almost all of the hyper converged infrastructure vendors is because we allow their customers to get far better control over there virtualized infrastructure.  We do this through our automated engine that attaches directly at the hypervisor level and gives intelligence to the workloads or VMs to properly size and place themselves while knowing the underlying capacity of the infrastructure. From our decision engine, our customers are able to:  Assure Application Performance in Real Time o   80% decrease in tickets and alerts (become more operationally efficient) o   Preventing problems before they become issues (we are the only platform that does this) Drive Efficiency in Environment  o   40% increase in VM/Host Density as workloads get the intelligence to dictate the resources they need, saving hundreds of thousands of CapEx in the infrastructure.Capacity Plano   Forecasting and tons of “what-if” scenarios around h/w refresh, DC moves, Consolidations etc...If given the chance for an introduction to the platform, I promise to respect your time through the process. Please let me know if this could be a possibility.  Best, James     </textOnly>
