Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Windows and SQL 2008 (R2) will go end of service within the next 18 months. While this may sound far off, the time to prepare is now.

As a top Microsoft Partner for assessments, migration, and optimizations, Turbonomic delivers the industry’s fastest, most precise, dynamic, cloud-ready migration plans to ensure a frictionless migration to Azure.

Join our webinar on October 3rd at 11 a.m. ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/turbonomic-6-2/]]&gt; where we&apos;ll discuss how a Big 4 Accounting Firm leverages Turbonomic to assess and migrate workloads to Azure and subsequently optimize their entire hybrid estate in Azure.
Regards,
Elizabeth
