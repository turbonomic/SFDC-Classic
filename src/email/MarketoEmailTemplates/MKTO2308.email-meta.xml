    <subject>Can I Send You a Pair of Rangers Tickets? (1494445744.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>​ Hi Brian, 
 With baseball season underway and summer right around the corner, I want to make sure you have a chance to spend some time cheering on the Rangers in Arlington. 
 Turbonomic is giving away a pair of Rangers tickets to the game of your choice (June- August) for simply scheduling a 30-minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer during the month of May. 
 Schedule your meeting here &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/Xgg0KjI0Z000HrmxX01aZe0]]&gt;, and we will get you over to Globe Life Park! 
 Best, Catherine
