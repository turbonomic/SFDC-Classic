    <subject>Exciting News- VMTurbo and JPMC</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Weâ€™re very excited to be working with the NetApp team to enable your customers to overcome challenges with maintaining consistent application workload performance as they scale out cloud and virtualization 
infrastructures. By increasing the reliability and ROI of the Data ONTAP platform by up to 30%, NetApp can reduce the expense associated with addressing customer performance issues and can differentiate itself with application service assurance, enhancing its competitive advantage.

VMTurbo was recently recognized by JPMorgan Chase, which inducted us into the Innovation Hall of Fame &lt;http://bit.ly/16w1bgT&gt;. A recent survey revealed that 89% of our customer realized value within just 3 months of deployment. 

We look forward to working with you and the NetApp team and partner network to bring this added value to ONTAP customers.

Sincerely,
The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
