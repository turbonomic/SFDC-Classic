    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

How has your experience with Turbonomic for Kubernetes on AWS been? We’d love to get your feedback.If you have any questions or concerns, just reply to this email and I’ll be in touch.

Core to Turbonomic’s value are the automatable, real-time decisions for Pod scaling and placement across EC2 instances. But we understand that getting comfortable with letting your Kubernetes cluster manage itself may take a little time. 

Our Green Circle Community &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/groups/cloud-native]]&gt; provides a forum for you to:


	- Share your thoughts and post questions
	- Learn how others are leveraging our autonomic platform
	- Get how-to guides to make your experience the best it can be
