    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Are you going to KubeCon in December? You’re building the new frontier, but cloud native at scale makes for highly complex infrastructure. How will you ensure your organization’s success?


Meet with our engineering executives to discuss:



	- Your 2019 roadmap to making Kubernetes standard across your organization

	- Best practices for managing complexity as you scale Kubernetes deployments 

	- How to leverage Istio, Prometheus, and Knative as you build next-gen platforms that self-manage

	- Your feedback on our roadmap as we extend our AI engine to serverless and beyond

Turbonomic was founded on the idea that software should manage IT resources, not people. If having platforms self-manage to deliver SLOs while you focus on what matters sounds good, let’s talk. 
 
Best,
