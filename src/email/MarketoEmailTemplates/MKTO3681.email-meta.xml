    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Can you imagine if your Application Performance Management solution detected a problem and the infrastructure automatically responded in real-time? If so, you should join ourÂ webinar this Wednesday morning at 11 am EST.


 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/true-application-aware-infrastructure/]]&gt;


During this live demo, Director of Technical Marketing and Technology Evangelist, Eric Wright will take you through a live tour of Turbonomic 6.1, with a focus on the impact of our deep integration with Gartner APM Magic Quadrant 2018 Leader, Cisco AppDynamics.


I hope you can join us &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/true-application-aware-infrastructure/]]&gt;!



Best,
