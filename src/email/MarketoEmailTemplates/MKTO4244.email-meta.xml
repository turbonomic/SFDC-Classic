    <subject>[Webinar] Maximizing Cloud Discounts in AWS &amp; Azure</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},


I&apos;ve been speaking with technologists like you to learn more about the way they manage their cloud and it&apos;s clear that balancing cost and performance is a top challenge. Some overpay while others experience slow performance due to budget constraints. This is a choice I think you shouldn&apos;t have to make. Join me on Wednesday, October 24th at 11 am ET, for our webinar &quot;Maximizing Cloud Discounts in AWS and Azure &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/enterprise-cloud-discounts/]]&gt;&quot; where I&apos;ll teach you several important ways to lower cloud bills and maximize performance in the cloud.


This 30-minute presentation &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/enterprise-cloud-discounts/]]&gt; will help you calculate cloud cost and deliver the best configuration to fit your workloads unique performance needs.


I hope to see you there.


All the best,
Eric Wright
Director of Technical Marketing, Turbonomic
