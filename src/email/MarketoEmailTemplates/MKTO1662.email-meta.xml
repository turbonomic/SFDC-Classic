VMTurbo Enables Safe
VMware-to-Hyper-V Diversification
{{lead.First Name:default=Are You}}:

Diversifying with Hyper-V (http://bit.ly/1fDv7d5)? The functional and economic benefits of Microsoft&apos;s ready-for-prime time hypervisor - as well as the growth of its surrounding ecosystem - have enticed many enterprises to consider the switch from vSphere.

Join us on March 19th for the premier of VirtualizationSoftware.com&apos;s Readiness Series featuring Scott Lowe and David Davis (http://bit.ly/1kbI1zj). You&apos;ll explore Hyper-V&apos;s exciting growth, the imperative of virtual diversification, and how VMTurbo drives this essential diversity.

Hyper-V has arrived. Diversify safely, from V to shining V.

In good health,
VMTurbo</textOnly>
