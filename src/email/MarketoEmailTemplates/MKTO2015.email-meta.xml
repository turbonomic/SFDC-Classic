Partner Promotion: VDI


VDI places significant demands on the underlying compute, storage and network infrastructure. Assuring end-users receive an experience equivalent to that of a physical desktop is a challenge. Turbonomic manages the significant resource demands and fluctuations which often stall VDI deployments by continuously assuring Virtual Desktops get the resources they need, when they need them. 

Until January 31st, 2017, partners who bring Turbonomic to a customer with a VDI environment will receive an additional 10% discount on their Turbonomic list price. Simply register your opportunity in the Turbonomic Partner Portal to receive this offer. PLUS! Partners will receive an additional 10% off their transfer price on any subsequent deal that closes within 90 days of the VDI deal.
