It really stood out to me and with your knowledge and passion I figured you would be interested in speaking with an engineer from Turbonomic.  Turbonomic is changing the IT world one day at a time and we have customers like EMC, Nike, HPE, and 1600 more that have adopted our way to managing the datacenter. Would you be open to a quick phone call to introduce you to Turbonomic. If it is interesting, Great! If not, we can do a virtual handshake and part ways.   Let me know what your week looks like in terms of connecting for 30 minutes. Hope to hear back,Katie                     Katie NorchiSales Development RepresentativeO: 857.305.4618  C: 440.708.8477500 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02116 </textOnly>
