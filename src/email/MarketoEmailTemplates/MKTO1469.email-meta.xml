Weekend Is Coming.
Dress Like A Warrior.
&quot;When I got mine, the first thing I did was burn all of my dress clothes.&quot; - Earl Sherman, Lead Virtualization Architect
When we got our new logo, the first thing we did was buy 1,000 white t-shirts, and plaster them with green goodness. No, not kale paste... The Green Circle (of virtual health) for which we have grown so famous. And thus, the VMT-Shirt  &lt;http://bit.ly/1o7fnV5&gt; was born.
