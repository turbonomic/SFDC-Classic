    <subject>Ways to Milk Your VMTurbo Trial</subject>
    <textOnly>   
We Gave You the Cow,
Now Milk It.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

VMTurbo&apos;s Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://bit.ly/Mdfu0g&gt; guides you through the process of Discover-Converge-Control-Plan, so you can fully leverage your VMTurbo Operations Manager trial for the next 30 glorious days. We gave you the cow. Now we&apos;re going to help you milk it.
Some Words of Wisdom from the farm:

 - Bookmark the Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://bit.ly/Mdfu0g&gt;.
 - Watch this disarmingly cute yet informative video &lt;http://bit.ly/1bMIQPP&gt; on our Economic Scheduling Engine (ESE), the abstraction model that recasts the resources of your environment as a free market of buyers and sellers, trading scarce goods and constantly driving the system to dynamic equilibrium.
 - Schedule a free assessment &lt;http://bit.ly/1gzh9Hf&gt; with one of our experienced dairy farmers, who can answer questions and provide you with real-time milking tips (it&apos;s an extended metaphor, where your VMTurbo trial is the cow and the milk is increased utilization, VM density, and application performance.)


Give a man a cow, and there&apos;s no telling how he&apos;ll use it. Teach a man to milk, and his virtual environment will live in a state of perpetual health. Yup. We just brought the metaphor full-circle.
