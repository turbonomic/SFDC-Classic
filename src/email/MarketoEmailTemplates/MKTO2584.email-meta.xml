Not only that - the performance went through the roof.” See more in the video below.  Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; The promotion mentioned below for $15,000 off Turbo offer still stands.

Subject: $15,000 off Turbonomic for State and Local Institutions  Vanetta, I’m reaching out with a special offer for State and Local Government organizations as we approach the summer months. I’ve worked with a number of governmental institutions including the Department of Energy – Energy Information Administration, and National Science Foundation to alleviate their IT infrastructure management challenges. They generally run within a July budget cycle and occasionally have remaining funds towards the end of their fiscal year. I typically find these customers bear one of two prevalent problems:
	- Their IT environments are highly fragmented, marked by high inefficiency and/or Their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resources.	- Their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resources.
 Turbonomic directly addresses both of these challenges. With that in mind, we’d like to offer a $15,000 discount for any deal with us, if you install Turbonomic’s autonomic performance platform before the end of May. 
Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction to you and the team at Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority over the next couple of weeks?  Going to Cisco Live?
