    <subject>Turbonomic Giants Game - Ticket Info</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


I hope you are as excited as I am to hang out with the Turbonomic crew Tuesday evening at AT&amp;T Park as the Giants take on the Rockies! I am reaching out to provide you with some final details to ensure you find your way to Suite 48.
I have your ticket, and from 6:00 p.m. until 6:45 p.m. I will wait in front of the Willie Mays Statue at the Willie Mays Plaza Entrance (located at the corner of Third and Kings St.). I will be wearing a Turbonomic t-shirt so I&apos;m easy to find, and will personally hand you your ticket. Then you are free to head up to Suite 48!
If you cannot arrive by 6:45 p.m., please email me and let me know so I may leave your ticket at Will-Call.
