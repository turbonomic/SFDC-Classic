Subject: RE: Referral from Linda King - Introducing Turbonomic  Hi Yusef, Following up from the email below, I wanted to see if we could put some time in the calendar for early May to have the initial discussion around Turbonomic and the benefits it could have for Elizabeth Arden before your calendar gets filled up.  Currently I am available the first week of May - Wednesday, Thursday and Friday anytime in the afternoon. Let me know what would be a good time for you to schedule the 30 minute initial discussion.  Best regards, James From: James Wilcox

Subject: RE: Referral from Linda King - Introducing Turbonomic  Hi Yusef, Thank you for getting back to me. I figured that might be the case after speaking with Linda a little bit about what you and the team have going on internally.  I’ll put a note in my calendar to reach back out in May. A lot of our current customers use our platform to help them plan for the migration of workloads and consolidation of workloads during acquisitions so that is what I was hoping to frame the conversation around for when May comes around. I’ve included some material below that gives more insight about how our platforms unique approach allows them to do so. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.  Tribune Media Completes Successful Data Center Migration with Turbo &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-Tribune-Media-Success-Story.pdf]]&gt;Turbonomic Increases Efficiency for Aspirus &lt;[[https://www.techvalidate.com/product-research/turbonomic/case-studies/43B-409-A99]]&gt; Have a great weekend! Best regards, James    From: Green, Yusef [mailto:Yusef.Green@ElizabethArden.com &lt;[[mailto:Yusef.Green@ElizabethArden.com]]&gt;]

Subject: Referral from Linda King - Introducing Turbonomic  This is an EXTERNAL email. Exercise caution. DO NOT open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or unexpected email. Hi Yusef,  After speaking with Linda this morning she mentioned that you are the best person to reach out to when it comes to initiatives that are going on within Elizabeth Arden’s infrastructure. She mentioned that you are very busy with the Revlon acquisition but I was still hoping that we could set up a ten minute intro call so that I can learn how to best support you and the team at Elizabeth Arden.  Here at Turbonomic we feel that the reactive approach to managing your virtual infrastructure should be a thing of the past. The biggest problem with the reactive approach is that it introduces risk into your environment, allowing for applications and therefore users to suffer from slowness. As you know, this has a significant effect on the business. Turbonomic’s economic scheduling engine allows for our customers to be proactive instead of reactive allowing them to see the following benefits:  ·         Reduce the amount of time spent caring for/maintaining your virtual infrastructure by leveraging software to analyze resource demand in real-time across capacity, placement, and configuration·         Act as a single pane of glass across your environment; across any technology ·         Providing executable actions around placement and sizing that can be leveraged in a manual or automated fashion to prevent resource-contention &amp; application delay·         Increase IT agility/compatibility to meet the business requirements·         Reduce future costs on servers, storage, and licensing, while maximizing the effectiveness of your current environment How does your calendar look over the next couple of weeks to align a discussion? I am confident it will be worth your time.  Best regards, James Wilcox  Sales Representative – Southeast Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  This message and its attachments are intended only for the designated recipient(s).
