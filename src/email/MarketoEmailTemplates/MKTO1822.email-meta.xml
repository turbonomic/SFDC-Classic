Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Capacity management as an operational discipline has existed since the advent of server-based computing, dating back to the age of the mainframe. Commercial tools to support this discipline have existed for more than 30 years with each successive generation of server platform creating its own unique requirements.
The introduction of virtualization introduced the Intelligent Workload Management (IWM) problem where capacity management was no longer a sufficient solution to assuring application performance.
