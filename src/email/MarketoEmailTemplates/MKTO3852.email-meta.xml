    <textOnly>Automation Was Made for Summer
Happy July Everyone! We&apos;re well into the summer - enough to lament the bygone cooler days - and what better subject to talk about than automation. Why? Because summer reminds us that for the most part, we&apos;d rather be at the beach than at our computers. And what better path to get away from tedious work than automate it.


Turbonomic workload automation gives you time back. As Jim Ganong at Accident Fund Insurance Company of America notes, it vastly reduces off-hours tickets, so your time is uninterrupted. It also simply helps your teams do more with less, as Jenn Neumann puts it:


We can do the jobs of 5 people with only 2. For us, Turbonomic replaces 2-3 technicians, and we aren&apos;t even using the full automation suite yet.
- Jeff Neumann, Virtualization Architect, Osage Nation


If you&apos;re reading this - thanks, Jeff! We&apos;re thrilled that automation is already delivering for you and are looking forward to being with you every step of the way. That is exactly why we&apos;ve started a series of live demos to help our customers fully automate with Turbonomic. Check it out:

There&apos;s too much lost time, opportunity, and money not to use Turbonomic as it was intended: self-managing, anywhere, in real time. With that I&apos;ll leave you with one more nugget of wisdom from another fellow Turbonomic customer:


Turbonomic does something that is hard to do. Not only does it recommend placement and sizing, but can be automated to take action. This is good practice for on-premises and a necessity for cloud...
- John Adam, Virtualization Administrator, George&apos;s

Forget Hybrid Cloud, Multi-Cloud is the New End Game &lt;[[https://www.cbronline.com/opinion/multicloud-strategy/]]&gt;
&apos;From opening up new opportunities for innovation to improving ROI, businesses are realizing the benefits of multiple clouds. &apos;From both a business agility and cost-efficiency point of view, achieving a balance of both public and private cloud options is proving to be a winning tactic.&apos;


The Cloud Wars Continue as Microsoft Tops Amazon in Q1 &lt;[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/04/27/microsoft-tops-amazon-in-q1-cloud-revenue-6-0-billion-to-5-44-billion-ibm-third-at-4-2-billion/#bf17cda5d4b6]]&gt;
Amazon has lost ground in its efforts to overtake Microsoft this past quarter. &apos;With Microsoft Azure Q1 revenue soaring 93% and Dynamics 365 SaaS revenue rising 65%, the better than expected growth is directly attributable to businesses across ever industry &apos;moving quickly to seize the digital dividend using data and AI,&apos; said executive vice president Judson Althoff in a blog post released with the earnings.&apos;
