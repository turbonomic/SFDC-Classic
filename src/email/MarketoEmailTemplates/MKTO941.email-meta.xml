This daylong event will be held Friday, February 13, 2015 at the Omni Hotel in San Francisco – the prior evening, we invite you to join us at the California Academy of Sciences &lt;http://www.calacademy.org/&gt;, to enjoy food, cocktails and live music while mingling with local wild life.
This exclusive event features a program of cloud and virtualization thought leadership discussions, customer keynotes, and an inside look at what is in store for VMTurbo in 2015.
You can register here &lt;http://vmturbo.com/turbofest-west-registration?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=turbowest_2015&amp;utm_content=invite&gt;, and a VMTurbo executive will also contact you to address any questions you may have.
