    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
 
We’re sorry to be missing you at the VMTurbo VIP Customer Cocktail Reception, but we do understand how busy these events can be.
 
Please drop by our booth, #611, and say hi. In advance of VMWare, download your free ParadisePack &lt;http://bit.ly/13GZHZ9&gt;, where you’ll learn more about how VMTurbo helps you gain control of your virtual datacenter so that you can relax and focus on other important aspects of your job.
 
Sincerely,

The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
