Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Now that you&apos;ve licensed your trial, VMTurbo&apos;s Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://bit.ly/Mdfu0g&gt; guides you through the process of Discover-Converge-Control-Plan, so you can fully leverage your VMTurbo Operations Manager trial for the next 30 glorious days. We gave you the cow. Now we&apos;re going to help you milk it.

 - Watch this disarmingly cute yet informative video &lt;http://bit.ly/1k2rfjP&gt; on our Economic Scheduling Engine (ESE), the abstraction model that recasts the resources of your environment as a free market of buyers and sellers, trading scarce goods and constantly driving the system to dynamic equilibrium.
 - Schedule a free assessment &lt;http://bit.ly/1gzh9Hf&gt; with one of our experienced dairy farmers, who can answer your questions and provide you with real-time feedback.
