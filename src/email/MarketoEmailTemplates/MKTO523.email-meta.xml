Converge &lt;http://bit.ly/1bMQ0U2&gt;.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
CONVERGE &lt;http://bit.ly/1bMQ0U2&gt; is the second step in VMTurbo&apos;s four-pronged approach to perpetual virtual health.

&quot;Converge &lt;http://bit.ly/1bMQ0U2&gt;&quot; comes from the Latin convergere, meaning, &quot;To come together and unite in a common interest or focus.&quot; Deep stuff.

&quot;But where should we converge with you?!&quot; you ask. The answer lies at the intersection of real-time resource supply and real-time application demand, or as we call it, The Optimal Operating Zone (OOZ). 

VMTurbo&apos;s Economic Scheduling Engine (ESE) not only drives your environment to the OOZ, but maintains it there perpetually, assuring application performance while also utilizing the infrastructure as efficiently as possible.

 Our Converge video &lt;http://bit.ly/1bMQ0U2&gt; in the Evaluation Resource Center walks you through convergence to the OOZ, to ensure you&apos;re getting the most out of your VMTurbo trial.

Questions, comments, or feedback? Converge &lt;sales@vmturbo.com&gt;.

United in common interest,
VMTurbo
