Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

We are happy to announce that VMTurbo 5.5 is now generally available. As with all releases, VMTurbo 5.5 adds more proof points in our journey towards controlling any workload on any infrastructure at any time. To get started with the new bits, simply update your VMTurbo appliance:


 - Update VMTurbo software online &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-1561?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRomrfCcI63Em2iQPJWpsrB0B/DC18kX3RUrJrSffkz6htBZF5s8TM3DUlJDXqpI6EEOSbA=]]&gt;
 - Update VMTurbo software offline &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-1292?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRomrfCcI63Em2iQPJWpsrB0B%2FDC18kX3RUrJrSffkz6htBZF5s8TM3DUlJDXqpI6EEOSbA%3D]]&gt;


Whats new:
VMTurbo extends Private and Public Cloud Control with 5.5. You can read more about what&apos;s new in the blog post announcement [insert blogpost overview link].



 - Assure vRealize Automation Performance 
Assure that dynamic changes introduced with the vRA self-service portal never degrade performance. VMTurbo now adds intelligent placement decisions into vRealize Automation workload provisioning 



 - Assure PowerVM performance 
A first in the industry, VMTurbo introduces automatable decisions including moving LPARS between frames as well as up- and downsizing for IBM power environments.



 - Migrate your workloads according to demand  
Break down any data center constraints and place workloads where they can perform the best. VMTurbo provides you with placement decisions across merged data centers so you can get the most out of your environments.



 - User Interface Improvements - HTML5
We are excited to give you early access to our new HTML5 User Interface with which you will be able to execute decisions easier. Click on the “New Design”-Button, which you can find under the gear box in the top right and test our new HTML5-interface.
