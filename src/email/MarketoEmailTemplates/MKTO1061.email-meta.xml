    <subject>How to Deliver Performance In A Shared Environment</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Expedient Data Centers &lt;http://www.expedient.com/&gt;, a leader in Managed and Data Center Services with locations from Cleveland to Memphis to Boston, unpacks the mechanics of how it consistently meets Service Level Agreements for its customers.

Watch this free webinar &lt;http://vmturbo.com/expedient-webinar?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=expedientwcast&amp;utm_content=04302015&gt; and learn how service providers use VMTurbo to provide consistent performance across all workloads, as well as the three roles a responsible managed service provider (MSP) takes in order to accomplish that directive:


 - Plan: assist customers in determining the most performant and efficient configuration of virtual machine resources
 - Operate: operate cloud infrastructure and inform customers of non-optimal configurations
 - Monitor: provide a consistent cloud platform for clients to have predictable and repeatable performance expectations
