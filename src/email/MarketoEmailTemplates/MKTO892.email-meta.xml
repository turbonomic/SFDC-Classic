Green Circle Member Exclusive:
There Is Still Time To Help Shape Our website
Hi, {{Lead.First Name:default=Green Circle Hero}}:
We’ve received some amazing feedback about our website re-design from the Green Circle over the past few days. In fact, some of the suggestions made are being put into production as you are reading this email.
The new site isn&apos;t ready quite yet though, and we want to make sure that we hear from as many of you as possible. Your opinions truly do count and the suggestions you provide will help to shape the look and feel of VMTurbo online.

All you have to do is click the link above, check out the new page and take the short pop-up survey. Once you&apos;ve completed the survey you will automatically gain 25 points in the Green Circle and a VMTurbo T-shirt as a thank you from us!
Important: In order to receive points, you&apos;ll need to submit your Green Circle Username on the last question of the survey.
