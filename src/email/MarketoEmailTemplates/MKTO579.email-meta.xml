Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


Thank you for downloading a VMTurbo white paper. We hope you found it informative and helpful in understanding how VMTurbo assures service performance and improves overall efficiency in virtual and cloud environments.  

Management tools and processes are essential to building a more automated, highly dynamic environment. In a recent ESG survey of IT managers with virtualization deployments (ESG Research Report: The Evolution of Server Virtualization), the most significant management challenges identified were:


 - Difficulty in isolating a root cause across a virtualized data center (34%)
 - Capacity monitoring and planning (32%)
 - Increased need for collaboration among infrastructure groups (27%)
 - Difficulty in identifying performance issues (26%)



Sound familiar? These challenges can be addressed with VMTurbo Operations Manager. How? Check out this quick 2 minute explanatory video &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/vmtvideo&gt; to learn more.
