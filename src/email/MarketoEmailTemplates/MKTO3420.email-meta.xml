Hi {{Lead.First Name}},


Spectre and Meltdown are currently consuming an enormous amount of IT cycles to patch and test. But the security risk is only the beginning of this headache – Spectre and Meltdown patches are often shown to have significant and unpredictable application performance impacts as well.



If you’re struggling to get on top of Spectre and Meltdown, and what implications these patches will have for your application performance, you are certainly not alone. 



Join us on Wednesday, January 31 at 1PM ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/spectre-and-meltdown-webinar/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=spectre_meltdown_webinar]]&gt; as we discuss how to mitigate the performance impact of Spectre and Meltdown.
