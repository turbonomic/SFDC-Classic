Dear {{lead.First Name:default=}}:

Please accept this personal invitation on behalf of Ben Nye, VMTurbo CEO and Bain Capital Managing Director, to join us for an Executive Breakfast on the morning of June 20th, from 7:30 to 9:00 a.m. Ben, along with a select group of thought leaders in our community, will be discussing trends and practical considerations for the software-defined era of IT. A few VMTurbo customers will also be on hand to discuss how partnering with VMTurbo has enabled them to improve their alignment with their company’s business goals by reducing the cost, risk, and complexity of delivering services across their private and hybrid cloud environments.

If you want to chat about the details, just give me a call. Because space is limited and we have received a high level of interest regarding this event, I would appreciate if you can reply to me as soon as possible regarding whether or not you will attend.

Friday, June 20th | 7:30 a.m.
Hancock Tower, 200 Clarendon Street, Boston | 39th Floor
