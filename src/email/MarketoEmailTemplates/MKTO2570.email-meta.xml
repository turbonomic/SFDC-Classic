Not only that - the performance went through the roof.” See more in the video below.  Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; The promotion mentioned below for $15,000 off Turbo offer still stands.

Subject: $15,000 off Turbonomic for UMaryland - SoM Scott - I’m reaching out with a special offer for state funded organizations as we approach the summer months. I’ve worked with a number of governmental institutions including Georgetown University, and Boston College to alleviate their IT infrastructure management challenges. They generally run within a June/July budget cycle and occasionally have remaining funds towards the end of their fiscal year. I typically find these customers bear one of two prevalent problems:
	- Their IT environments are highly fragmented, marked by high inefficiency.	- Their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resources.
 Turbonomic directly addresses both of these challenges through our intelligent automation, enabling teams to increase the infrastructure’s capacity and the performance of the applications they run (see more in link in signature). With that in mind, we’d like to offer a $15,000 discount for any deal with us, if you install Turbonomic’s autonomic performance platform before the end of May. 
Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction to you and the team at University of Maryland - SoM over the next couple of weeks?  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jE1TdcbMLlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhOGFW3XjrxoLLVYsNbfLVhxc1g8azr3WQQ7MiLlgGcT0oWVGNtOSupWKgmrBP%2DCcIvVDOz0ynsL4N7nh8ulb8j2pmbSpqj1ker7Gnc2jmiAGN0yeWu%5FnKbPcxQkoYIkUwR8nwSWLPP7g%5FK%2D%2D4AsQkM0L9Nrkx22PZfc89P2gqLDHS65YLeW9JWb6C2wu7hha9wOy8fudQtdkTHK1bqG4uvVDdIo0qYkB0WYAJjKWlwLcp%5FvjSkqlZ5Vf00SxmzrgEV3VYsjL1bjNjoiDazZXq5FifIlEGjyAGsOrg1l3%2D7uI8n0HiOH16ouak%2C/j0lWd8zGL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwt0x3V19ZqOQNUr7t8deF89gfdy%5FKjgaMJFE6iJLP8bGKYRZ0dlcOEu7UjHdgYj9ZJhcW%2DFBmZNH06G9jlYwucSrp3vlCEM7RzQ%5FQEPOTfwsiyriIt0qUQWV%2D2jVJ5IgiD0agPAH2YG%5Fbg%2C%2C]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jE1TdcbMLlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhOGFW3XjrxoLLVYsNbfLVhxc1g8azr3WQQ7MiLlgGcT0oWVGNtOSupWKgmrBP%2DCcIvVDOz0ynsL4N7nh8ulb8j2pmbSpqj1ker7Gnc2jmiAGN0yeWu%5FnKbPcxQkoYIkUwR8nwSWLPP7g%5FK%2D%2D4AsQkM0L9Nrkx22PZfc89P2gqLDHS65YLeW9JWb6C2wu7hha9wOy8fudQtdkTHK1bqG4uvVDdIo0qYkB0WYAJjKWlwLcp%5FvjSkqlZ5Vf00SxmzrgEV3VYsjL1bjNjoiDazZXq5FifIlEGjyAGsOrg1l3%2D7uI8n0HiOH16ouak%2C/h0xSc8TMdlBQuVN5sfaYL6z%2D0SLJdpuno5xpHOXk3cEx1EF9PO%5FANR7ig8duCJ05OLuGNCM7KZpCwSlyNPOwWtMV%5Fux2J0CBUjL1ioPbRqpFZKZZifMkrY6J0XhTnOiRi3X5LmYPTERrIVW5LOwE]]&gt;  </textOnly>
