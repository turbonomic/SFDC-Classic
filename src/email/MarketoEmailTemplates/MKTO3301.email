<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Dear&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Please join me for an exclusive, invite only executive networking dinner&nbsp;I am hosting on <a href="https://turbonomic.com/learn-phoenix/" target="_blank">Tuesday, November 14th at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse</a> to discuss the benefits and challenges of adopting a Hybrid Cloud Strategy.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In my more than 25 years in the IT industry, I have had the privilege of watching IT go through waves of disruption as an implementer and from a birds-eye view. All previous waves pale in comparison to that which we observe&nbsp;today.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reinvent their&nbsp;hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging and mistakes are costly.&nbsp;We will discuss this unprecedented shift our industry currently faces and how we as the stewards of our generation&nbsp;can lead the innovation charge. It is my goal and&nbsp;hope that this networking opportunity will be intellectually stimulating and beneficial for all.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation.&nbsp;As space is limited, I do ask that you please <a href="https://turbonomic.com/learn-phoenix/" target="_blank">register here</a> as soon as possible.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Yours Sincerely,</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Tom Murphy</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Tom Murphy<br /></em></span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Chief&nbsp;Marketing Officer</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12px;">Turbonomic, Inc.</span></em></span></p>
