Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We were sorry to have missed you at VMTurbo’s Newest Release Preview Webinar: From Chaos to Control. We had a great discussion about how the latest release of VMTurbo Operations Manager improves performance and reduces infrastructure cost across the virtual datacenter through software-defined control. And although we missed you this time, we are pleased to provide you with a recorded version &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/operations-manager-webcast-thank-you/&gt;  of the webinar. 

As part of the recording, you’ll have an opportunity to listen in on the live Q&amp;A from the session. And you will likely have questions of your own, which we will be happy to discuss with you. 

Take a look at the attached recording and then let’s grab 15 minutes to chat. We’ll contact you shortly to set up a time. 

Sincerely,

The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
