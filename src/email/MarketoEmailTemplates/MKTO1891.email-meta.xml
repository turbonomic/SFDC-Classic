In our latest e-book; Memory Management Fundamentals: Memory Ballooning, Memory Swapping, Hypervisor Swapping, and more &lt;[[http://vmturbo.com/thx-wp-memory-management-fundamentals-thank-you?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=memory-management-wp&amp;utm_content=07202016]]&gt; learn about:


	- Memory Ballooning
