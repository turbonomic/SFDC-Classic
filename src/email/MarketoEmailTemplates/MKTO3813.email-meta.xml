Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

It was great seeing you this week at Cisco Live!


As a follow-up to our introduction, we&apos;d like to invite you to join us for a live webinar featuring Turbonomic automated control and optimization of a Cisco UCS environment. With the powerful combination of Turbonomic and Cisco UCS, we further extend the full stack capabilities of workload automation in your data center.

In this 30-minute live demo, Director of Technical Marketing and Technology Evangelist, Eric Wright will showcase the complete understanding and control – extending from the physical to the virtual layers of the stack – that Turbonomic brings to a Cisco UCS environment. 
 
We hope to see you there!
Regards,
