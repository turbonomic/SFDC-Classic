Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
Thanks for stopping by our virtual booth at VMware Forum 2013. We hope you enjoyed the event and that we were able to provide you with the information you need to determine how you can reduce capital and operating expenses by 30% or more and defer expenses you don’t need to incur just yet as you approach 2014. 

But the proof is in the pudding. We invite you to download this free trial &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; of Operations Manager so you can see what software-defined control looks like in your own environment. The download itself is quick and easy.  You’ll see first-hand how quickly and easily you can gain control of your virtual IT and see why so many of our users have reported significant CapEx and OpEx reductions over a short time.



Sincerely,
 The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
