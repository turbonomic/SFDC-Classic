    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


You are making a major investment of your time by attending the Gartner IT Operations and Cloud Strategies (IOCS) conference.
 
With a content packed week and 100’s of sessions to choose from, deciding where you spend your time is critical to your return on the event. To avoid the aimless wandering through the sea of vendors and captivating sessions, we aim to share 3 proven actions that will have a major impact. 
 
When you schedule a 30-minute meeting at the event with Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.jifflenow.com/gartnerioc2018/external_request/c7607e]]&gt;, our cloud experts will explain how you can:



	- Accelerate your cloud migration efforts from months to weeks

	- Reduce your cloud bill by 30% or more without compromising performance

	- Maximize the discounting associated with Reserved Instances (RI) eliminating costly guesstimates



Both Microsoft and AWS trust and promote the use of Turbonomic’s software platform to their customers and partners.
 
Schedule a 30-minute meeting today &lt;[[https://turbonomic.jifflenow.com/gartnerioc2018/external_request/c7607e]]&gt; and guarantee yourself a return on the event before you even arrive.
