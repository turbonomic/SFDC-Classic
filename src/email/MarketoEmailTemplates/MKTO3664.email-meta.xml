    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

With the release of Turbonomic 6.1, our AI-powered decision engine now extends the power of workload automation to the cloud, the datacenter, and even to containers.

To celebrate, you are invited to join our webinar, Using Artificial Intelligence to Continously Maximize Cloud Cost Savings, which will take place on Wednesday, March 23rd at 1pm ET.
 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/using-artificial-intelligence-to-cut-cloud-costs/]]&gt;

During the webinar, you will learn how Turbonomic’s AI-powered decision engine continuously optimizes RI recommendations in concert with resizing automation – to drive the elasticity AND cost savings you want and expect from the cloud.

We hope to see you there!

Regards, 
Team Turbonomic
