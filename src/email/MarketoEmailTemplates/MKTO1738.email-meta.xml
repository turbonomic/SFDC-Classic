    <subject>VMTurbo Top Ten Features #9: Cluster Capacity</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

You&apos;re 90% there! Here we go...
Feature #9: Cluster Capacity

VMTurbo creates ROI by maximizing VM density, on average, 30% higher than customer baselines. The Cluster Capacity dashboard is integral to this calculation, and answers the question:

 - How many VMs can I add to a cluster without sacrificing performance?

Step-By-Step: Cluster Capacity

The following steps will guide you through the Cluster Capacity Dashboard:

 - Summary lists the number of VMs, Hosts, and Datastores in each cluster; Headroom calculates the number of additional VMs that could be supported by the existing cluster hardware
 - Cluster Resource Summary shows details about Total and Peak Utilization, HA Capacity, VM Allocation for Hosts and VMs, and datastore information such as Total Used Capacity, Free Space, and Utilization Percentages
 - The Number of VMs per Hose/Datastore panel, dark green bars show the current number of VMs per host and light green bars illustrate the number of VMs each host can reliably accommodate
 - Cluster Headroom provides another view at the remaining capacity of the cluster, where dark green represents the total number of VMs currently running, and light green represents how many additional VMs can be added
 - By default VMTurbo runs a set number of cluster capacity calculations per day, based on a specific VM template. These default settings were chosen to conserve resources consumed by the VMTurbo server. To alter the number of cluster calculations per day, or to modify the VM template, go to Policy &gt; Cluster Capacity &gt; templateName and/or numClusters &gt; Click Apply
