    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 
I hope this note finds you well! My name is ***INSERT NAME*** and I cover the ***INSERT REGION*** for Turbonomic. I&apos;m reaching because I understand your organization is ***PLANNING FOR/UNDERGOING***a hardware refresh. I&apos;d like to see if you would be open to a conversation about how Turbonomic’s technology can address some of the challenges specific to infrastructure projects such as this for ***COMPANY***. 
As you’re aware, engaging in a hardware refresh offers many opportunities for improvement, from faster application response times to more reliable services for end-users. Today&apos;s virtualized and cloud environments are highly dynamic, however, and inaccurate or incomplete projections can quickly lead to being underprepared to meet unexpected demand, or overspending on unnecessary hardware. 
I’d like to spend some time sharing with you how we‘ve helped organizations like Mayo Clinic and Six Flags (***feel free to change***) overcome these challenges and implement their hardware refreshes with success. 
Would you be open to a conversation at ***INSERT DATE*** at ***INSERT TIME***or ***INSERT TIME***?   Best,   ***INSERT NAME***</textOnly>
