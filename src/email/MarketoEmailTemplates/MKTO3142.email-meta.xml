    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


I hope you are as excited as I am to hang out with the Turbonomic and Corus360 crew tomorrow evening at Coors Field as the Rockies take on the 
Marlins! I am reaching out to provide you with some final details to ensure you find your way to Suite 62B.
I have your ticket, and from 5:10 p.m. until 6:10 p.m. I will wait in front of the Sandlot Brewery next to Gate B (located at the corner of Blake St and 22nd St.). I will be wearing a Turbonomic t-shirt so I&apos;m easy to find, and will personally hand you your ticket. Then you are free to head up to Suite 62B!
Please let me know if you cannot attend so that I may reallocate your ticker or if you cannot arrive by 6:10 p.m., I will leave your ticket at will 
call
