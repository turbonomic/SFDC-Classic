Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},






We’d like to cordially invite you to join us for an exclusive networking event in Baltimore on June 19th at The Woodberry Kitchen.
  
Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reimagine their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go into the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging – and mistakes are costly.
