Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
A few months back VMTurbo conducted a survey titled How Are You Fighting Latency? The investigating started as way to better understand the role, measurement, and mitigation of latency in the modern datacenter. It quickly extended into the implementation of containers and microservices, as these architectures introduce new latency challenges.
554 Enterprise IT and Data Center professionals completed the survey and the results are rather eye opening!
Some of the key findings include:


 - 91% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the minimization of latency is important to their company, with 23% of respondents identifying a clear majority of hosted workloads (between 60 percent and 100 percent of workloads) as being Latency-Critical.
 - 32% of respondents either do not measure latency or do not know if their company measures latency


This is just the tip of the iceberg, if you want to learn more about how the IT industry is fighting latency click below!
