One of the most widely used, and often misunderstood terms is “policy-driven”.  More and more of your organization’s goals and strategies are making their way into software at the tactical layer.  The way that successful software platforms are able to map to your business objectives is through the use of policy. These policies can include many different variations such as:



	- requiring specific workload and data locality (e.g. data sovereignty and geo-restriction)

	- defining maintenance windows and operational processes for workloads

	- setting resiliency and availability minimums for scale-out and distributed applications 




The goal of automation is to use software to make the decisions and perform actions where people cannot (or should not) due to the complexity and scale of those actions and decisions. Policies which reflect business and IT rules will ensure that the real objective can be achieved, which is to enable trustworthy automation.


Policy-driven automation is what brings trust to the operations and development teams in the way of guardrails or boundaries within which a high trust of systemized automation can be adopted. The rapid increase in the size and complexity of both on-premises and cloud environments requires a systemized approach to workload automation that can deliver high trust results. This is where policy-driven automation is opening the doors to safely increasing utilization on your infrastructure, and much more. Trustworthy automation means that operations and development teams can get back to increasing overall IT productivity and giving more value back to the business.

towards automation. &quot;What really stresses out the network is humans,&quot; notes Vijoy Pandey, Google head of engineering. &quot;It is actually humanly impossible to do changes in the size of the network we have.
