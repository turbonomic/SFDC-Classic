I’m reaching out to let you know that Turbonomic is giving away a pair of Rangers tickets to the game of your choice for simply scheduling a 30-minute meeting &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/turbonomic-rangers-game-summer-giveaway/]]&gt; with a Turbonomic engineer during the month of May.
Turbonomic works with financial services organizations like JP Morgan Chase, Barclays and GM Financial to improve their workload performance while reducing infrastructure complexity to provide the highest quality services to their customers and end-users.
If you aren&apos;t a Rangers fan (I myself am a Red Sox fan), I&apos;d be happy to send over a pair of Aggies tickets so you can cheer on your Alma Mater during their upcoming season. You can chose the game!   You can schedule your meeting by filling out this form &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/turbonomic-rangers-game-summer-giveaway/]]&gt;. I hope to speak with you soon!   Best, Catherine
