    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/vdi-strategy-autonomic-methods-webinar?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wbnr-vdi-12072016&amp;utm_content=11302016]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
 Gartner contends that the VDI market hit 76 million users this year, and will grow to 1.3 billion over the next three years. Although virtual desktops represent just a fraction of the world’s virtualized workload footprint, VDI architecture and resource consumption presents a uniquely challenging workload class with many permutations of possible implementation. Join us on December 7th at 12:00 PM ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/vdi-strategy-autonomic-methods-webinar?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wbnr-vdi-12072016&amp;utm_content=11302016]]&gt; to explore the unique challenges associated with VDI, and will demonstrate how Turbonomic’s autonomic approach to performance assurance and resource management can help your organization. During this webinar we will cover: 

 	-  Accelerate virtual desktop performance by 30% or more on 30% less infrastructure, entirely by properly sizing and placing VDI workloads 	-  Confidently plan for and scale your VDI investment without overspending on delivery infrastructure 	-  Accommodate unpredictable fluctuation in end-user activity and IO-storms through real-time decision automation 	- Maximize the number of virtual desktops managed per administrator 	- Hear firsthand from a top global consumer goods company that has completely automated its VDI operations with Turbonomic
