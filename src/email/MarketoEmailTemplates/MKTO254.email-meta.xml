Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Time crunched? 
If you consider the 10 minutes it takes to read this analyst report to be a luxury of time you don’t have, you’re not alone. So we’ll make it worth your while. 

Too good to be true? 
Automation,  Economics, and Efficiency – all benefits of IaaS. However, with these benefits come a number of challenges, such as constant change and fluctuation driven by interdependencies and complexity in the IT stack. 

And who has time to manage the ever-increasing number of mission-critical applications running in the cloud? 

Not you, that’s for sure. Take a look at this short report &lt;http://bit.ly/15OhkdZ&gt; from Neovise and learn about a new approach from VMTurbo that enables effective management so that you can take advantage of all the benefits of cloud technology.

 
Best regards,

The VMTurbo Team
