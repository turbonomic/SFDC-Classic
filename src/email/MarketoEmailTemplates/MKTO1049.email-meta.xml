    <subject>Data Centers Are Consuming More Than Ever Before. Help Plant Back.</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
It’s no secret: data centers are consuming more energy than ever before.

In fact, they are the fastest-growing consumers of electricity in the United States.

The problem? Most data center servers are wildly underutilized. Even with virtualization, the majority of servers never come close to using their full capacity. 

This is why utilizing your infrastructure as efficiently as possible is so important. In fact a recent NRDC study found that increasing server utilization could reduce data center electricity consumption by up to 40% - resulting in annual savings of $3.8 billion for US businesses and 39 Billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
