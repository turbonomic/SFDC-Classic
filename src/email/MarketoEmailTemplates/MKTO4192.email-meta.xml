Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 
 
We&apos;d like to cordially invite you to an exclusive networking event in Boston on Thursday, November 1st at the TD Garden!
 
Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reimagine their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging – and mistakes are costly.


Boston IT Networking Event &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/boston-vip-2018/]]&gt;
TD Garden, Boston

Thursday, November 1st | 7PM EDT
 
Join your technology peers in a private suite for an evening of networking and basketball at the TD Garden, as Kyrie Irving and the Boston Celtics take on Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks! Food and beverages will be served.
 
We hope you will join us by registering here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/boston-vip-2018/]]&gt;.
 


Sincerely,




Erica Price</textOnly>
