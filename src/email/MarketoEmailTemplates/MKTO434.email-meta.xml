Enterprises are adopting elements of the software defined datacenter to improve agility and contain costs as they move toward private, public, and hybrid cloud architectures.

Columbia professor Yechiam Yemini - whose expertise is in distributed systems - will be hosting a session on practical considerations for cloud architectures. 

We&apos;ll also be raffling an Xbox One and a PlayStation 4. Space is limited, so please RSVP today. 

Sincerely,
