Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
 
 Is your data center virtualized? Is your team challenged with how to handle application performance degradation or resource bottlenecks? Or would you like to improve resource utilization or more intelligently plan for growth?

Read this brief success story &lt;http://bit.ly/Uhatqm&gt; regarding how the London School of Economics (LSE) used VMTurbo Operations Manager to:

 - Ensure applications have the physical and virtual resources they need
 - Maximize resource utilization
 - Plan for new workloads and growth in their environment

VMTurbo Operations Manager &lt;http://bit.ly/SY81or&gt; helped LSE reduce OPEX and improve service levels.  Would you like to see if VMTurbo can do the same for you?
