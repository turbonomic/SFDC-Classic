    <subject>See you in Nashville?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

 
I am pleased to invite you to attend the Nashville Executive Networking Event &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/exec-nashville/]]&gt; on March 27th alongside your fellow IT leaders. As Field CTO at Turbonomic, I find that the best ideas stem from conversations and meetings with others who are dealing with the challenges posed by the current paradigm shift of the public cloud, containers and edge computing. That is why I hope that you will join us on the 27th for an afternoon of networking and thought leadership.
 
Following our discussion, we will head to the Turbonomic Suite at Bridgestone Arena to watch the Nashville Predators take on the Minnesota Wild.
 
I hope to see you there!
