Achieving VM-to-Spindle
Storage Control
{{lead.First Name:default=FACT}}:

Approximately 25% of virtualization dollars are dedicated to storage, with much of this spend wasted on over-provisioned IO and disk capacity. By effectively controlling the end-to-end relationships between workloads and storage, organizations can:

 - Reduce ongoing storage costs by 20-30%
 - Reliably virtualize IO-intensive applications
 - Actively prevent complex storage problems
 - Intelligently thin-provision, deduplicate, and compress storage volumes to optimize datastore efficiency

VMTurbo’s Aligning Virtualization &amp; Storage Management &lt;http://bit.ly/1mL9ddp&gt; whitepaper explores the most common storage performance issues, and how your organization can leverage Storage Magazine&apos;s 2013 Product of the Year &lt;http://bit.ly/1jCKrtQ&gt;, to own your environment from VM to spindle.

It’s a new era in storage management.

Thinly provisioned,
