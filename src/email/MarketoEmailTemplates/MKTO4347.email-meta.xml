Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

At AWS re:Invent this year, you can expect 50,000 attendees, thousands of sessions, hundreds of opportunities for hands on-learnings, and only 5 days to accomplish it all. It&apos;s easy to get overwhelmed but go in with the right information, and you&apos;ll walk out victorious.
