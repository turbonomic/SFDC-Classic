    <subject>Using AI to continuously maximise cloud cost savings</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/using-ai-to-cut-cloud-costs/]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Many IT teams start out by manually purchasing Reserved Instances (RIs) and manually rightsizing cloud instances to try to keep a lid on cloud costs.

But then – cloud usage grows and changes accelerate. Instance sizes change. New instance types are released. It’s hard to manually utilize the entire RI portfolio, but if you under-buy RIs, you’re leaving huge cost savings on the table.

Join our live webinar on Thursday, June 7th at 2pm GMT to learn how Turbonomic’s AI-powered decision engine continuously optimizes RI recommendations in concert with resizing automation – to drive the elasticity AND cost savings you want and expect from the cloud.

I hope to see you there.
