    <subject>VIP Invite - Luxury Suite at Warriors Game 12/14</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

I am writing you to wish you a Happy Holiday Season and invite you to our exclusive, VIP executive event with Turbonomic, Pure Storage and Cisco next Thursday night, (12/14) in a luxury suite at the Warriors game. Bill Veghte, our Executive Chairman (ex-EVP/GM Microsoft and HP) will be hosting this special event. As we watch the Warriors vs. the Dallas Mavericks, we will have a brief executive forum on today’s hybrid cloud challenges (how management risks are formidable and oversights are expensive).

Bill helped build Azure for Microsoft and is currently our Executive Chairman and is personally helping to lead our engineering relationship with both AWS and Microsoft. We have 1800+ customers including HP (results below), Cisco, Conoco Phillips, Citi, JPMC, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, BMC and many more worldwide.

I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. As space is limited, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-sanfrancisco/]]&gt; as soon as possible or reply to this email confirming your ticket.

Please let me know if you can make it!

Warmly,

Judi Feeley
