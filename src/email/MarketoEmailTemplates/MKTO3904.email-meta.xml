    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you for attending the Turbonomic IT Networking Dinner this week at Fat Ox! It was a pleasure to meet with you, and I hope you enjoyed your evening.
 
We wanted to let you know about an upcoming webinar taking place on July 25th, during which we will be discussing our integration with Microsoft Azure. You can register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-azure/]]&gt;.
 
We hope to see you at another Turbonomic event soon!
