Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


 Imagine a scenario where you don’t have to spend your time fighting fires and chasing down issues in your virtualized environment because it’s maintained in an ongoing healthy state. 
 
We offer a better approach than the tools you already have to automate control of your virtualized environment. Check out this short overview &lt;http://bit.ly/XYnaGJ&gt; and this free report from Forrester Research &lt;http://bit.ly/15CFjfs&gt; to learn how easy it can be to gain control –and put down the fire hose.


Thank you,
