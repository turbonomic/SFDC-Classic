    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We have recently issued an update for VMTurbo Operations Manager that we want to make you aware of. You can find more information &lt;http://bit.ly/11FkHBX&gt;, including release notes and instructions for updating your appliance, on our Support &lt;http://support.vmturbo.com/home&gt; 
site.

While an update is not required, customers are encouraged to be on the latest version of our software. This empowers your organization with the latest features and functions of our solution.

In addition, I want to make you aware of the next FREE Jumpstart Training session on May 9 at 12pm ET. Register &lt;http://bit.ly/14d9YTo&gt; now, as seating is limited. If you require something more detailed or customized, we have other Product Education offerings &lt;http://bit.ly/WbucrR&gt; as well.  

Please contact me if you have any 
questions regarding the update.

Best regards,

Steve Gorman
