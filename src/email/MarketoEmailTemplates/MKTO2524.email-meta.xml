Interstingly enough Manhattan Associates is a customer of our who we were and to increase the overall performance of their applications by as much at 37% on 1/3 less infrastructure. customers like Nike, H&amp;M, Mitre 10 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-Mitre10-Success-Story.pdf]]&gt;, EMC, Cisco etc. rely on Turbonomic’s technology to dynamically allocate resources within the virtual environment and cloud environments to assure performance in the most efficient way possible, in turn making for a smooth process from point of sale, to on time delivery. Turbonomic dynamically allocates resources based on what your applications demand, at any given time— not more, not less. This will help your team better support the business as it will make sure that mission critical applications get the resources that they need, when they need them— but not by over provisioning and being inefficient.Results:
	- Increase orders complete per minute by 23% &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_ECommerce.pdf]]&gt;	- Increase application response time by 37% &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_ECommerce.pdf]]&gt;
