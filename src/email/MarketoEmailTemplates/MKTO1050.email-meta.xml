    <subject>Why Successful Businesses Care About Latency</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{Lead.First Name}},

The numbers don’t lie—latency sucks…profits.

Consider the following:

You’ve done the research. Here’s a recap of what VMTurbo can do for you:


 - Amazon found that 100 ms cost them 1% in sales. In terms of its 2014 revenue of $88.94 billion, 1% is $889,400,000. Not insignificant.
 - One study found that a 1 ms advantage can be worth $100,000,000 to a major brokerage firm.
 - It’s so costly that $1.5 billion to lay the first trans-arctic ocean fiber optic cables in order to cut latency between London and Tokyo by 30% is a practically steal.



It’s no wonder then that businesses care about latency—and the successful ones are doing something about it.

A Principled Technologies study found that VMTurbo improved application performance through actionable recommendations—specifically cutting latency by 37%. The report details the methodology and results of the study
