During the intro call with Darryl, we were able to show Darryl how Turbonomic is able to make his job easier, giving more visibility into the NetApp storage layer and helping to make placement and sizing decisions around each data store to help him realize more wasted storage, and freeing up more capacity.  Darryl mentioned that the next best step would be to show you how Turbonomic can provide the same automated actions to you on the compute level as well as you are more involved with day to day virtualization management. In short, we were hoping to have a 30 minute call with you to introduce Turbonomic and show you how our actions allow our customers to increase application performance on less infrastructure.  Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks for an introduction call?  Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  Going to Cisco Live?
