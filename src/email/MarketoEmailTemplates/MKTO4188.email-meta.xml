Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I’ve been speaking with IT Leaders like you about the ways they are migrating their on-premise workloads to AWS &amp; Azure while consolidating their on-premises footprint.  What has become clear is this problem is beyond human scale.

Turbonomic&apos;s Workload Automation solution for Hybrid Cloud enables our 2000+ customers to reduce the cost, risk, and complexity associated with the migration and consolidation. 

Our agnostic platform (supports VMware, AWS, Azure, etc.) provides ongoing optimization both on-premise and once workloads are in the cloud to ensure you’re only paying for what you consume.

For a bit more context, please see the resources below:
