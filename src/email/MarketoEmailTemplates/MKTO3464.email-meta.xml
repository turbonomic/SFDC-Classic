    <subject>You&apos;re Invited: Washington DC Executive Networking Reception and Wizards Game</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},



In my more than 20 years both investing in and running enterprise IT companies, I have had the privilege of watching IT go through waves of transformation from a birds-eye view. All previous waves pale in comparison to that which we observe today. Data center and cloud advancements are happening at an unprecedented rate. That means more decisions will have to be made, requiring a broader set of skills to keep your workloads healthy. 

I cordially invite you to join myself and dozens of our fellow IT leaders in Washington DC for the upcoming DC 
Executive Networking Event: Workload Automation for Your Hybrid Cloud &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/exec-district/]]&gt; on Tuesday, March 6th 2018 at the home of the Washington Wizards, the Capital One Arena at 5:30PM. 


This event is a great opportunity to meet with peers, share challenges, and discuss trends. It is my goal and hope that this networking opportunity will be 
intellectually stimulating and beneficial for all. Following our reception, myself and your technology peers will take our seats in the Turbonomic Suite to cheer on the Washington Wizards as they take on the Miami Heat.

I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. As space is limited, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/exec-district/]]&gt; as soon as possible.



Yours sincerely,
Ben
