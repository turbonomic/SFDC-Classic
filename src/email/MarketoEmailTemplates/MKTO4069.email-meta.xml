    <textOnly>HiÂ {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Are you or your teammates planning to attend Microsoft Ignite? If so, I would like to offer you an exclusive invitation to a 30-minute meeting with members of our executive team.

Whether you&apos;re looking to accelerate your adoption of Azure or to optimize the performance and cost of your environments, we can help. Turbonomic&apos;s deep integration and robust support for the Microsoft ecosystem can empower all this and more on your journey to hybrid IT.

In your on-site briefing at the Orange County Convention Center, you will gain VIP insight into Turbonomic&apos;s roadmap and all the current capabilities of our hybrid cloud management platform. I would be delighted to schedule you with a member of our executive team to learn more at Microsoft Ignite. Simply let me know by replying to this email with your preferred date and time.

Also, be sure to visit Turbonomic at booth #315 in the Expo Hall. We hope to see you there!

Regards,
