    <subject>Turbonomic Top Ten Features #5: What-If Scenarios</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

Halfway there! Here is your fifth of ten Turbonomic Top Features. Of course, if at any time you want to accelerate your learning, you can visit the Green Circle Community &lt;[[https://greencircle.turbonomic.com/welcome?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ENG-HybridCloud&amp;utm_content=Mid05]]&gt; and gain tips and tricks from real Turbonomic customers and evaluators just like you.
Feature #5: What-If Scenarios


Turbonomic empowers you to run robust What-If capacity planning scenarios in just minutes using real workload consumption profiles. The Plan tab helps you answer the following questions:



	- What if I need to add workload?
	- Can I consolidate my data centers?
	- What if I upgrade my infrastructure?
	- Does my environment have N-1 resiliency?
	- Can my data center support migrating workloads to the public cloud?


Step-By-Step: What-If Scenarios





The following steps will guide you through the Plan tab:



	- Click the + Icon to create a new plan, Folder Icon to open or delete an existing plan and Save Icon to save a current plan/generate a plan report
	- In the Configure panel, use the Scope, Projection, Demand, Supply, Baseline, and Advanced Settings options to prescribe the What-If Scenario you would like to model:


	- Scope changes the portion of the environment for which you will simulate the What-If Scenario

	- Projection simulates adding a constant rate of workload to the environment on a linear time basis

	- Demand simulates adding or removing specific amounts of new consumers (applications, VMs, containers) to the environment and the impact this will have on Supply
	- Supply simulates adding or removing specific amounts of new providers (compute, storage, network) to the environment and the impact this will have on Demand
	- Baseline changes the peak utilization timeframe used by the What-If Scenario calculation
	- Advanced Settings allows you to set utilization levels, whether the plan can recommend provisioning or suspending infrastructure, whether the plan can recommend resizing VMs, and similar fine-tuning details


	- Click the Run button to run the What-If Scenario, and check the Ignore Constraints checkbox if you would like the plan to calculate additional efficiencies that could be achieved by removing cluster boundaries

	- Once the What-If Scenario is done running, the results will appear in the windows to the right of the Configure panel
