Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

It was great to meet and spend some time with you at VMware Forum on 2nd May – thanks for taking the time to come by and see us. As a follow-up to the event, I&apos;ve linked below a few of the many resources designed to dive deeper into the ways VMTurbo will dramatically improve how you control and automate your virtual data center.

 - Trial Download &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; - check out VMTurbo in your environment, absolutely free
 - Online Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://bit.ly/Yz66Yv&gt; for product and support info

And if you missed my breakout session, How to Guarantee VM Performance and Maximize Utilization, feel free to take a look at this whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/11v0WKW&gt;.

My team will be following up with you shortly to understand your priorities and interest in learning more about VMTurbo.If you would like to set up some time to get a more in-depth, tailored demonstration of our solution, please let us know here &lt;http://bit.ly/145VraT&gt;. 

Kind regards
