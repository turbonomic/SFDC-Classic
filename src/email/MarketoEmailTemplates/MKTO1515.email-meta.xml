Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Public clouds are relatively new in the IT landscape and their adoption has accelerated over the last few years. Multiple vendors now offer solutions as well as improved on-ramps for workloads to ease the adoption of a hybrid cloud model. With these advances and the ability to choose between a local data center and multiple public cloud offerings, one fundamental question must still be answered: What, when and where do you run your workloads?
Despite these challenges the benefits of the hybrid cloud far outweigh the costs. This blog post explores the top 3 challenges of introducing hybrid cloud and how you can manage these challenges.
