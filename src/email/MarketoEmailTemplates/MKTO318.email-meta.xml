Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thanks for taking the time to come by and see us at the VMware User Group in Solihull. As a follow-up to the event, we’ve linked below a few of the many resources designed to dive deeper into the ways VMTurbo will dramatically improve how you control and automate your virtual datacentre.

You’ll learn about a new approach to virtualisation management that deploys intelligent workload management to optimise configurations and maximise resource efficiency, preventing performance risks from manifesting, giving you, the professional, the control.
