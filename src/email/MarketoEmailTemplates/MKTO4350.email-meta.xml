    <textOnly>Platform and Partnership Updates
While November marks the beginning of the wind down heading into the holidays, we’re not slowing down the innovation happening at Turbonomic. We know that you and your teams are living through an exciting and challenging time as the IT industry continues its rapid adoption of public cloud and increasing move toward running containers in production. As a result, engineers and operations teams everywhere are exploring and educating themselves on what’s next and how they can help their organizations get to where they want to be as quickly, accurately and responsibly as possible.

We’re here to help you, every step of the way! For example, our engineering team has been hard at work extending our public cloud 
capabilities, including new features, new platform integrations, and performance improvements (stay tuned for more detail). And, to ensure we deliver the best possible experience, these updates incorporate feedback received through our early access program – directly from customers like yourself, which is instrumental as we continue enhancing our award-winning platform. 

If you’re heading to AWS re:Invent this month, please come see us in booth #413 to get a sneak peek of our early access release first hand!
