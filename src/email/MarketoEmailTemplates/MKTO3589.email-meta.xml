    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thanks for stopping by the Turbonomic booth at AWS Summit San Francisco. As promised, here is a resource that shows how we help our customers migrate to the cloud:

 &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/accelerate-cloud-migration-projects]]&gt;

Turbonomic can help you reduce your projected cloud spend by optimizing your on-premise workloads before migration and determining needed AWS Reserved Instance (RI) capacity.

Learn more and start your migration with confidence.

Regards, 
Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
