Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

You’re busy – fighting fires and chasing down issues consumes too much of your team’s time and focus – and it’s becoming more complex as you expand virtualization and adopt cloud services.
 
We have a better approach to automate control of your 
virtualized environment. It’s being used by hundreds of other organizations like BT, CSC, Coca-Cola, VeriSign, and Indiana University to drive down costs, improve virtual workload performance and maximize resource utilization.
 
If you give us 30 minutes of your time for a short, no pressure demonstration &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/request-a-demo.html?source=email&gt;, we can help you save so much more. Our Software-Defined Control system automates the decision-making process for your IT ops team and provides intelligent actions that maintain your virtual environment in a healthy state.
