    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},   
Given (INSERT CURRENT PROJECT OR INSIGHT ON ACCOUNT), I’m confident a meeting between yourself and Turbonomic’s founder Dr. Shmuel Kliger, will be an interesting proposition.
    
      Our technology enables all application workloads residing on cloud and virtual environments, to get the resources they need from the underlying infrastructure in real time, to assure end user QoS and safely drive densities across your platforms (significantly reducing CAPEX, OPEX and time).    
   Since 2015 deployment, Ian Penny of Barclays (CTO) has leveraged our platform to great effect:   
 
	- $12M savings in CapEx deferment over 12 months through infrastructure purchase avoidance
 
	- 33% workload density increase across 100,000+ workloads, all running under full Turbonomic automation
 
	- 20% reduction in workload provision time through deployment integration
 
	- 10,000:1 Workload:FTE ratio, increasing employee productivity 400%
 
    
   At JPMC, we delivered George Sherman (Managing Director):   
 
	- $3.9M immediate CapEx deferment, adding 3,000+ additional VMs without additional infrastructure
 
	- 6,500 ESX host environment identified over provisioned by 1,950 hosts
 
	- 40,000+ VDI workloads - 35,000 initial performance assurance actions, and ongoing performance assurance for all workloads across on-premises IaaS environment
 
    
   I appreciate you are very busy, but Shmuel would be happy to come and visit you at your offices in (LOCATION), should you have availability on (DATE OPTION 1) or (DATE OPTION 2).    
   Looking forward to your thoughts and availability.   
   Kind Regards,   {{company.Territory Owner:default=edit me}}</textOnly>
