I am recently assigned to NYC territory and came across an account, Funtech, that had seen us in the past and you were a part of that deal. I wanted to reach out to see if we could bring this back on the table and maybe connect this week. Let me know what you are thinking, would love to connect. Best,Katie                     Katie NorchiSales Development RepresentativeO: 857.305.4618  C: 440.708.8477500 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02116 </textOnly>
