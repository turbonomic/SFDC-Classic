Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

The word &quot;Converge&quot; comes from the Latin convergere, meaning, &quot;To come together and unite in a common interest or focus.&quot;

Converge where? At the intersection of real-time resource supply and real-time application demand, or as we call it, The Optimal Operating Zone (OOZ). VMTurbo&apos;s Economic Scheduling Engine not only drives your environment to the OOZ, but maintains it there perpetually, assuring application performance while utilizing your infrastructure as efficiently as possible.

 Our Converge video &lt;http://bit.ly/1bMQ0U2&gt; in the Evaluation Resource Center walks you through convergence to the OOZ, to ensure you&apos;re getting the most out of your VMTurbo trial.
