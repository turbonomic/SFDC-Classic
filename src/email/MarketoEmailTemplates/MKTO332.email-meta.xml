Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

At VMTurbo, we’re seeing many organizations like yours concentrating efforts on trying to increase utilization of their existing server and storage infrastructures to prepare for projects upcoming in the new year.  Over 80% of our customers have indicated they were able to increase resource utilization by more than 20%, while almost two thirds saw this value within 15 business days.

We’d like to offer you a no-cost fast and easy download &lt;http://bit.ly/16EwPYr&gt; of our Virtual Health Monitor, which will allow you to maintain proactive control and address potential problems before they become full-blown headaches. The result: peace of mind that you are maintaining your virtual environment in a healthy state and are driving down the costs of troubleshooting while you defer IT infrastructure expense until you absolutely need to incur it.

Sincerely,
 The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
