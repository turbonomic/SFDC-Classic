The goal of the discussion is to reintroduce Turbonomic, show the new features and learn about what initiatives we can help out with for you and the team. Just as a reminder, Turbonomic enables our customers to run more efficiently within their virtual environment, while allowing them to assuring performance of their most critical applications. The reason our customers chose us over the any other virtualization platforms out there is because of our unique automation allowing our customers to:  ·         Increase VM to host density – increasing efficiency by 30% (and defers future hardware cost with in-depth planning capabilities)·         Increase application uptime by 35%+ ·         Decrease amount of alerts and time spent firefighting in the environment This allows our customers to save a large sum of budget usually spent on hardware, and properly allows them to plan for the new aspects of the infrastructure like a hyperconverged infrastructure, or investments in the public/private cloud offerings. &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jEBYd8LPKlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhOCE6mTHX1laXeT4dGYrl63cxosae33yYQo9nfwhrJEVscQSxBUAWEb5cOnQS1PJsTayrV12HFbYUUujgKorEP5qWeLp6Q93mN72rOwAKoOGt3zdW1zlvoNro6z%5FkMlhII3Fc%5FUNfHsRjz6%2DkLjhchzOUnlDJl2690B%5FNx4kHZByXuwpvCd8V7Rue%2Dg9ug5akYRyxmiIgEbWzccE%2DyOKeNQHAo5RWkuGQBPDQ3E2J0H%2DsGoxepjll%5FdtMgFyPntjkhyWwm0fpRi6DeiyOSZXS8PXKqphST5QOjMKM3xky4kt1ysDzVBg%5Fk1sdnQUGGBubdpWzgR7f7q0I9bOxLUPoLE46%2Dmf2z8t44jxPNDHO1ma3XWFo%2C/j0tTdsfLI1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpxd9z2kdwZunBLA76mN9eHZYhKt2LEwAfHZ9syQ8VG%2D6RMahw37h5ClWzFQj3haTOIZ1Kd%2Dt%2D19Ve66euhTIdn%5FypqFbvCGkkd35aSVLJbLIkrjLpPpw6XS2Er3bNJpEJhQ9N15sn%2D4eAS4an4lqV0m3H4ACJcQJZoZK%5F]]&gt;  Do you have ten minutes to discuss a potential partnership to see if we could do the same for you and the team at Covington &amp; Burling? Best, James   From: James Wilcox

Subject: Turbonomic (formally VMTurbo) reintroduction  Mike – Touching base here to see if you might have time over the next couple weeks to discuss Turbonomic once again and the benefits it could have for you and the team at Covington &amp; Burling.  After looking at past notes, it seems there was interest in how Turbonomic can provide control over the VMs that span across three different data centers, allowing you to increase application performance while also increasing infrastructure efficiency.  See link below for more details:   &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XZsdnPsTW3Ljpdv8q5wNdW3LyyXR56dynZf2-VMg402?t=https%3A%2F%2Fturbonomic.com%2Fresources%2Fvideos%2Fturbonomic-customer-success-story-aci-payment-systems%2F&amp;si=5027260677488640&amp;pi=8670fd7d-42d1-4241-9e0c-20b3d7d60094]]&gt; Do you have 30 minutes to provide a reintroduction to Turbonomic over the next couple of weeks?  Best,  James </textOnly>
