    <subject>Do you want to lower cloud spend?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi  {{Lead.First Name}},
I wanted to personally reach out to you about today&apos;s webinar &quot;How to Unlock Cloud Elasticity to Lower Cloud Bills &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cloud-eq/]]&gt;&quot;. I know how easily your monthly cloud bills can get out of hand, and I&apos;d like to show you how automation goodness with Turbonomic can help.
In this 30-minute session at 11 am ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cloud-eq/]]&gt;, I will share:


	- What is the difference between cloud scalability and cloud elasticity 
	- How to determine the right compute &amp; storage templates in AWS or Azure
	- How to push the bounds of cost optimization in the cloud

	- How to automate workload scaling based on your percentile or time preferences


This time may help you deliver a truly elastic infrastructure and lower cloud bills monthly by 30% or more.
I hope to (virtually) see you there.


All the best,


Eric Wright
