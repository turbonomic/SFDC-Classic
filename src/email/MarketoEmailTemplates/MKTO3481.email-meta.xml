    <subject>You&apos;re Invited: Washington DC Executive Networking Reception and Wizards Game</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},




I hope this email finds you well.  Data center and cloud advancements are happening at an unprecedented rate. That means more decisions will have to be made, requiring a broader set of skills to keep your workloads healthy. While you can&apos;t automate people, you can automate workloads, and accelerate business growth.




I&apos;m looking forward to hosting an event in your region on Tuesday, March 6th 2018, the Washington DC Executive Networking Series: Workload Automation for Your Hybrid Cloud &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/exec-district/]]&gt;, to discuss these advancements with CIO&apos;s, Executives, and leaders from organizations like yours. Together we will learn about the adoption of workload automation at the scale of hybrid cloud.
 


Following our cocktail hour and presentation, we&apos;ll take our seats in the Turbonomic Suite for the evening to watch All-Star Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards take on Dwayne Wade and the Miami Heat.




Will I see you there? As seats are filling up fast, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/exec-district/]]&gt; as soon as possible.









Yours sincerely,
Ben
