VMTurbo FreeStart Technical Workshop
13th November 2012 - Luton, Bedfordshire

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
 
 As companies broaden their use of virtualisation and adopt cloud services, the management approach must change to solve for the interference and resource contention that often accompanies a shared resource model, and take advantage of the increased fluidity now provided.  The biggest challenge organisations face is how to ensure the performance of mission-critical applications while getting the most out of their virtual infrastructure. It’s a very complex problem – and a delicate balancing act. The cost of getting it wrong is enormous.

VMTurbo &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com?source=email&gt; has developed a game changing approach, namely Decision Analysis as opposed to Data Analysis, to manage the quality of service of virtualised applications whilst enabling more efficient use of infrastructure.

VMTurbo is the only real-time operational solution that collects a broad range of performance metrics, continuously analyses them, identifies anomalies and performance bottlenecks, recommends resolutions and automates their execution.  VMTurbo closes the loop between collecting data and controlling the environment. This solution taps into the increased agility provided by virtualisation to continually tune, adjust and plan how the infrastructure is optimised based on the needs and demands of an organisations entire infrastructure today and in the future. 

What makes VMTurbo technology unique is its ability to allow you to:


 - Prevent vs. Predict
 - Embrace Automation 
 - Drive Maximum Infrastructure Efficiency 
 - Build and Manage Cloud Services 
 - Virtualise Business Critical Applications 
 - Simplify and Unify Virtualisation Management 

For an insight into this new technology, our partner Satisnet would like to invite you to a detailed FreeStart Workshop, including hands-on technical sessions, on 13 November.

Places for this workshop are limited!
