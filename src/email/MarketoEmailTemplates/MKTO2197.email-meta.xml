Subject: RE: Jon - Discussion cloud and virtualization automation Jon, For the reasons mentioned below, I truly feel that you would see a lot of value in how Turbonomic can be the control system to tie into each technology you have already invested in, allowing you to have control over your entire infrastructure.  EDF Delivers the Hybrid Cloud &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/videos/turbonomic-customer-success-story-edf-re-delivering-cloud/]]&gt; Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction/educational overview to Turbonomic? Best, James  From: James Wilcox

Subject: RE: Jon - Discussion cloud and virtualization automation Hi Jon, Following up on the email below, with the investments in AWS, Citrix XenApp/Server, Microsoft Azure, and VMware’s hypervisor I feel strongly that you will see the benefits in Turbonomic’s ability to tie in each of those technologies to provide one pane of glass for optimizing your on-premise infrastructure while ensuring that your team does not overspend on templates that AWS and Azure provide.  Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks for my team and I to provide an introduction?  Best, James  From: James Wilcox

Subject: Jon - Discussion cloud and virtualization automation Jon - From my research I can see that you and the team from AARP made an investment in VMware’s hypervisor to allow you to scale out your business at a lower costs. I was hoping to discuss with you how our platform Turbonomic allows our customers to continue to scale and grow their business at a low cost, enabling teams to capitalize on the investment they made in virtualization.  Turbonomic is different from the VSuite of tools and does what VMware’s VRops and VSphere &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__vmturbo.wistia.com_medias_r67l1kk7i5&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=U0G0XJAMhEk_X0GAGzCL7Q&amp;r=gCM-eHqoYayWsyj2WpjQpy-xt8VFoVSjREH3qzN_pFc&amp;m=erZ9PuJjze5t-BnkoKw3YD3ubcDm5HdGJRnou-bx7q8&amp;s=53sYZb5wf_W8KiyzTM-PNOLY6alH3VAgam1tf0ILPGA&amp;e=]]&gt; can’t to allow our customers to prevent problems from ever entering their environment.  Typically teams run into three separate questions when continuing to virtualize within their infrastructure:  ·         Are the virtual machines properly sized and placed within the infrastructure so we know the applications are getting the right resources they need in order to run optimally? ·         Do we have enough capacity within our existing infrastructure to onboard X numbers of virtual machines? ·         Are the virtual machines onboard and sized properly? And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications?  Turbonomic answers all these questions for you and your infrastructure team as well as help you plan for any workloads you are looking to onboard to Azure or AWS public cloud. This allows for our customers to increase operational efficiency as alerts decrease by 80% and increase infrastructure efficiency while still assuring application performance.  Autonomic Platform for AWS &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__turbonomic.com_wp-2Dcontent_uploads_Turbonomic-2Dfor-2DAWS-2DData-2DSheet.pdf&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=U0G0XJAMhEk_X0GAGzCL7Q&amp;r=gCM-eHqoYayWsyj2WpjQpy-xt8VFoVSjREH3qzN_pFc&amp;m=erZ9PuJjze5t-BnkoKw3YD3ubcDm5HdGJRnou-bx7q8&amp;s=3mReZ6b3APbsUhioO1Tag23HlKFuCK1umYrQ0lifxGc&amp;e=]]&gt; Jon, do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks for an introduction? Best regards, James Wilcox  Sales Representative – Southeast Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   </textOnly>
