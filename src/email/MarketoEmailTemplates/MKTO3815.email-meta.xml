    <subject>Upgrade to Turbonomic 6.1 for Application-Aware Workload Automation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I hope this note finds you well! I’m following up on the email I sent to you recently, offering a free assessment of your environment through the lens of Turbonomic 6.1.

We’ve received amazing feedback on the release from customers who have taken advantage of this upgrade, and I want to make sure you don’t miss out on the ability to leverage our improved product functionality. As a reminder, some of the updates you can benefit from include: 


	- Maximized Reserved Instance Utilization in AWS
	- Application-Aware Infrastructure Management through Integration with AppDynamics
	- Self-Managing Container Platforms, across Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift and Pivotal Cloud Foundry
	- Executive Dashboards Showing Performance Improvements and Savings



If you’re interested in exploring 6.1 with a Turbonomic engineer, please reply to my email so we can schedule a time to connect.




Best,

Dave
