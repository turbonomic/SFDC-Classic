    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
 
We do hope to see you at the reception on Monday, August 25.

Meanwhile, download your free  ParadisePack &lt;http://bit.ly/13GZHZ9&gt;, where you’ll 
learn more about how VMTurbo helps you gain control of your virtual datacenter so that you can relax and focus on other important aspects of your job.
