Subject: times for conversation on monday Hi David, Sorry to have caught you at home, hopefully your daughter starts feeling better and you get to enjoy some of your weekend home!  Just looking to reconnect with you and have a quick conversation to see if revisiting Turbonomic makes sense for you at this time.  I am free during these blocks:8am-9am11am-12pm We should need only 15 minutes just to touch base, let me know when works best for you. Thanks,Maggie  Margaret Schroeder - Turbonomic
