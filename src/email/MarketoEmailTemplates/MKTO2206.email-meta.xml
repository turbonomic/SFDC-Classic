    <textOnly>Morning Craig-  I hope this note finds you well! My name is Chris, and I cover the Tennessee here for Turbonomic ( from Memphis). I’m reaching out to see if you would be open to a conversation about how Turbonomic’s technology can help address some of the problems specific to healthcare IT professionals.  With greater pressure than ever before to implement EHR/EMR and demonstrate meaningful use, the healthcare IT landscape is becoming more complex each day. Combined with the mission critical nature of healthcare applications, strict industry regulations, and looming cost implications, your job overseeing the virtual and cloud infrastructure isn’t easy.  I’d love to spend some time sharing with you how we’re helping organizations like Baptist Memorial, Covenant Health, Dialysis Clinic, TeamHealth, and more - overcome these challenges and improve the management of their virtual infrastructures. Below is a figure displaying the results we have driven across all our current healthcare customers:  Would you be open to a conversation next Tuesday at 10 am or 1 pm ? If you&apos;d like to learn more, take a look at our Turbonomic for Healthcare Providers solution brief &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_Data-Sheet_Healthcare.pdf]]&gt;, which explains the value we can add in more detail.
