    <subject>You&apos;re Invited -  Hybrid Cloud Executive Networking Dinner with Turbonomic CMO Tom Murphy</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Please join me for an exclusive, invite only executive networking dinner I am hosting on Tuesday, November 14th at Mastro&apos;s City Hall Steakhouse &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-phoenix/]]&gt; to discuss the benefits and challenges of adopting a Hybrid Cloud Strategy.

In my more than 25 years in the IT industry, I have had the privilege of watching IT go through waves of disruption as an implementer and from a birds-eye view. All previous waves pale in comparison to that which we observe today. 

Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reinvent their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging and mistakes are costly. We will discuss this unprecedented shift our industry currently faces and how we as the stewards of our generation can lead the innovation charge. It is my goal and hope that this networking opportunity will be intellectually stimulating and beneficial for all.

I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. As space is limited, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-phoenix/]]&gt; as soon as possible.

Yours Sincerely,

Tom Murphy
