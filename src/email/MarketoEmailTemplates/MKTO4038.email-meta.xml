Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


We&apos;d like to cordially invite you to an exclusive networking event in Boston on September 20th at the J.Crew shop in Copley Place!


Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reimagine their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go into the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging – and mistakes are costly.


Boston IT Networking Event
J.Crew, Copley Place
Thursday, Sept 20th | 6:00 PM


Join your technology peers at the J.Crew Men’s shop in Copley Place for drinks and your very own personal suit stylist.


We hope you will join us for this discussion by registering here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-boston/]]&gt;. 




Sincerely,


The Turbonomic Team</textOnly>
