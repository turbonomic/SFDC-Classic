Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}}, 
Thanks again for registering for the Turbonomic 6.0 release webinar! We&apos;re grateful that you were willing to spend an hour with us as we introduced the exciting new functionality that 6.0 offers to our customers.
If you missed the webinar live (or wanted a copy of the recording or slides), we&apos;ve packaged it all up for you to review in your own time. 
With our previous release, we extended our platform’s on-premises capabilities with new support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure public cloud environments. In Turbonomic 6.0 we are going beyond compute and expanding our support of the public cloud stack, as well as introducing many other new features to deliver the most comprehensive hybrid cloud management platform.
