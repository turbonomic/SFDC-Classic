    <subject>Join Turbonomic and Actifio for Dinner at Gilberth&apos;s | 6/13 at Pure//Accelerate</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},



Are you going to Pure//Accelerate in San Francisco? If so, we’d love if you could join us and our friends at Actifio for dinner!


After the Hall Crawl on Tuesday, June 13th, we will be heading over to Gilberth&apos;s for a Latin inspired dinner. If you are planning to attend the conference, or simply will be in the San Francisco area, and are interested in joining Turbonomic and Actifio for dinner at 7:30pm, RSVP here &lt;[[http://info.actifio.com/pure-customer-dinner-signup]]&gt;.
 
While you’re there, don’t forget to stop by our booth to learn more about Turbonomic’s partnership with Pure Storage, and get a sneak-peek at our brand-new user interface and upcoming product release.
 
I hope to see you in there!
 
Best,
Steve
