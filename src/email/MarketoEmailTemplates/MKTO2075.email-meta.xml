Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Microsoft&apos;s virtualization platform Hyper-V has evolved significantly over the years and has adapted to emerging market trends. Despite these advancements something that hasn&apos;t changed is how we manage these environments.
We often see users moving to Hyper-V as a way to curtail costs, if you are moving to or leveraging a Hyper-V environment for cost how are you going to continue to scale the environment without introducing unnecessary capital expenditures?
