    <subject>Your KubeHunt Registration - Details for Tomorrow</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


The hunt begins tomorrow! Below are some of the details:



	- Meet us at Fira Gran Via, outside Hall 8, North Entrance: Check-in (look for two people wearing the KubeHunt t-shirts) to get your KubeHunt T, as well as Game Rules &amp; Locations
	- Party Buses leave at 18:00 (6 PM): Donâ€™t forget - you are picking your own team of 3-5 and using the time on the bus to strategize your hunt.

	- Food and drinks will be served at the reception, immediately following the KubeHunt starting at 20:00 hrs at the Ocana Club.



See you soon!


Cheers,
Your KubeHunt Sponsors
