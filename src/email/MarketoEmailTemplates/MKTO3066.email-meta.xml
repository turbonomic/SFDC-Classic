    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
It was great meeting you at AWS re:Invent, we hope you enjoyed the show and are honored you took time to stop by the Turbonomic booth.

We are pleased to offer you Turbonomic AWS Cloud Manager &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/aws-cloud-manager?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=aws-reinvent-2016-us&amp;utm_content=12-12-2016]]&gt;. Free for 6-months, just spin-up the AMI and get ready to see value within minutes (can you say “Self-managing EC2 instances?”).
