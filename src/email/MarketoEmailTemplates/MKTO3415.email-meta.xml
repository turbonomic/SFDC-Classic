    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},


The product management team at Turbo is conducting a short survey on cloud adoption and your input is appreciated. The survey has 9 questions and should take less than 5 minutes to complete.


For your time,Â we will be sending the first 150 respondents a $20 Amazon Gift Card shortly after the completion of the survey.

Your feedback will help us understand how you&apos;re adopting cloud services, what it means to you and where we can help. If you&apos;re interested in giving feedback on our cloud roadmap or learning more about any of our plans there&apos;s an option within to let us know and we&apos;ll be in touch.
