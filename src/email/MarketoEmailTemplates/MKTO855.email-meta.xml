    <subject>New VMTurbo Operations Manager Release</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I just wanted to let you know that Operations Manager 3.2 Update 2 (Build 19954) has been published and it is highly recommended that you implement this latest release. You can find instructions for online and offline updates here &lt;http://bit.ly/YMdFeS&gt;.

We&apos;re also looking for your support.  VMTurbo has been named a finalist &lt;http://bit.ly/WWplvd&gt; for the 2012 Tech Trailblazer awards in the virtualization category. Since you are a current user of Operations Manager, we are shamelessly soliciting your vote. To vote for VMTurbo, click here &lt;http://bit.ly/TfSoHD&gt;. You will receive an email to confirm your selection (so check your SPAM folder in case it gets stuck there). It&apos;s that easy.  Any valid email is eligible, so please pass it on to the rest of your team.

Thanks,
Steve Gorman
