    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.Lead Owner First Name}},

Thanks for stopping by our booth at TechCom. I know there wasn’t much time to get into detail about the technology, so I wanted to personally invite you to our Green Circle Community &lt;http://t.signauxneuf.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgcW5jlW7gbZWP2m4qM8F42Qjy2mMVmdwVQb003?t=http%3a%2f%2finfo.vmturbo.com%2fUbzF06H0gI0ZgR012Z000tn&amp;si=6003933757571072&amp;pi=11ce539d-c04f-4be6-b0df-e33f39c4b361&gt; to continue the discussion.

The Green Circle was designed as a peer-to-peer online community of  innovators, virtualization experts and forward-thinking IT pros. Members can engage with other customers and VMTurbo engineers and have an active dialogue about product ideas and other questions. It is a site where you can find case studies, best practices, industry perspectives, product discussions and lots more.

We’re working on a page within this community that will be dedicated to CSC, but in the meantime I wanted to share this link with you so you could get a better sense of how other customers are leveraging VMTurbo.

CSC Zurich &amp; BizCloud rely on VMTurbo to help control their virtual and cloud estates, and we’ll work with those teams to develop specific content relevant to CSC.

Once the group is ready, I’ll send you an updated link with access!

Regards,

Justin J. Kutticherry
