    <subject>How Sky Betting &amp; Gaming Outperformed the Market</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi  {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

With their business scaling at high percentages year-over-year, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming could no longer survive on their current system of management. Once they implemented Turbonomic in their environment, they were able to handle an increased number of complex workload transactions while more efficiently using their infrastructure.

&quot;If we&apos;re slow our customers will simply go elsewhere. With Turbonomic in place, we are confident that our products will perform well.&quot; - Lee O&apos;Donnell, Director of IT Infrastructure &amp; Security at Sky Betting &amp; Gaming
