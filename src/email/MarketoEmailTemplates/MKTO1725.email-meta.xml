Feature #7: Custom Reports &amp; Dashboards

Custom Reports &amp; Dashboards give you the flexibility to serve multiple Administrative Users, Line-of-Business owners, and IT Executives by showing them the specific information they 
want to see, and nothing more. Custom Reports &amp; Dashboards answer the following question:

 - How can I view the health of a cluster or 
group?
 - How can I create dashboards and reports for the information I care about 
most?

Step-By-Step: Custom Reports &amp; Dashboards

The following steps will guide you through Custom Dashboards &amp; Reports:

 - You can customize any dashboard using the buttons atop the Dashboards pop-out (Left-to-Right):
- Scope allows you to adjust the scope of any existing dashboard elements
 - Reset resets the dashboard, including its scope, to default settings
 - + Icon (Create) launches the Custom Dashboard creation mode, discussed in Step 2, below
 - Edit allows you to edit the dashboard
 - Save allows you to save the dashboard for later, or for consumption by specific users
 - Delete deletes the dashboard
 - Direct-to-PDF saves the current dashboard as a PDF, .xlsx, or as a Report under the &quot;Reports&quot; tab
 - Custom Dashboard Creation Mode  provides a simple drag-and-drop user interface with 22 pre-configured panel options: Utilization, Projected 
Improvements, To Do, Usage, Group Trend, Audit Log, Health, Optimize Improvements, Resize Info, Storage Info, Entity Resources, Entity Trend, Inventory, VM Operating System, VM Density, Capacity 
Resources, Related Entities, Query Result, Supply &amp; Demand, Executed Actions, QoS Level, QoS Impacts*

*You can set the Scope of each drag-and-drop panel individually, OR you can add an Inventory panel, and drag-and-drop inventory elements (for example, a specific cluster) from the 
Inventory panel to the other drag-and-drop panels to scope to that element.
