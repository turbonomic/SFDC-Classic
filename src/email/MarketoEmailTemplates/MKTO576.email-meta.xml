Last Call &lt;http://bit.ly/1fhE5MZ&gt;.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Your free trial of VMTurbo Operations Manager ends in 7 days. Like last call at an open bar, we implore you to make this final stretch count.
Before your trial ends, run some Historical Reports to see just how far you environment has come, or schedule a live demo for professional, one-on-one insights into the solution &lt;http://bit.ly/1fhE5MZ&gt;.

If you haven&apos;t observed a significant increase in performance and efficiency, you&apos;re still using &apos;the other guys&apos;.

If you&apos;re convinced that life without VMTurbo would be unbearable, let&apos;s talk about licensing the product &lt;sales@vmturbo.com&gt;. We&apos;ve really enjoyed our time with you, and this doesn&apos;t have to be good-bye. 

Call me,
VMTurbo
