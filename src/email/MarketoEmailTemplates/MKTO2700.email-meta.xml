    <subject>CONFIRMATION - 2017 Turbonomic MLB All-Star Experience Entry</subject>
    <textOnly>{{Lead.First Name:default=there}}, I just received a notification that you entered our 2017 Turbonomic MLB All-Star Experience Raffle. In order to remain eligible to win, you must schedule and complete an introductory meeting with Turbonomic prior to June 23rd. Are you available for a conversation this week?  We’ll use this time to review your team’s goals, challenges, and overall objectives, then give you a high-level introduction into Turbonomic’s autonomic workload management platform.  If I don’t hear from you within the next day, I’ll give you a call - looking forward to speaking with you!  Best, {{company.Account Owner First Name:default=Maria Rodriguez}} {{company.Account Owner Last Name:default=}}</textOnly>
