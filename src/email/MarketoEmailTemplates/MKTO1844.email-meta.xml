Webinar: Unearthing a Dev Lab, VDI, &amp; $200K in Savings in Garland, Texas &lt;http://vmturbo.com/vmturbo-webinar-garland-texas/?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_campaign=xccelerator&amp;utm_content=100214&gt;

Unearthing a Dev Lab, VDI, &amp; $200K in Savings is the compelling story of how one man’s hunch turned into a movement that transformed a city’s IT infrastructure. Hear from Garland’s Senior System Engineer Dammions Darden on how Garland combated both performance issues and inflated hardware over provisioning ratios across the city’s siloed departments. Mr. Darden consolidated and automated his workloads, re-purposing the freed-up hardware for a VDI deployment and development lab. All told, his consolidation projects saved the City of Garland a conservative $200K in licensing and hardware costs.
