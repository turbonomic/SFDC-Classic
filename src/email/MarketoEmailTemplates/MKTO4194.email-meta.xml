Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Windows and SQL 2008 (R2) will go end of service within the next 18 months. While this may sound far off, the time to prepare is now. Join our webinar tomorrow at 11 a.m. ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/turbonomic-6-2/]]&gt; where we&apos;ll discuss how a Big 4 Accounting Firm leverages Turbonomic to assess and migrate workloads to Azure and subsequently optimize their entire hybrid estate in Azure.

Not available tomorrow but interested in learning more about how you can optimize your cloud migration strategy? Join us next week &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cloud-eq/]]&gt; as we explore how you can improve your cloud elastic quotient.

 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cloud-eq/]]&gt;

During next week&apos;s live demo, we&apos;ll dive into the idea of rapid elasticity—the promise versus the reality—and how you can narrow the gap, especially with a few new enhancements in our latest product release.
We hope to see you soon!


Regards,
