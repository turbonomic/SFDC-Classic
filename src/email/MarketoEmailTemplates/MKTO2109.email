<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hi Catherine,</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I understand that Lululemon is a consumer-facing company, with a large e-commerce platform, handling payment transactions for thousands of customers each day. As I am sure you know a few milliseconds of delay in page load time can be disastrous:</span></p> 
<ul> 
<li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The average shopper is 40% more likely to leave your site for a competitor if your page takes longer to load than 2 seconds</span></li> 
<li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">One study found that a 1-second delay in webpage response time can impact overall sales conversions by 7%</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It is along these lines that I would like to introduce you to Turbonomic. B2C organizations like Rue La La, Expedia and Wayfair leverage Turbonomic to ensure that high-priority, business-critical applications, including online shopping carts, e-payment, search functionality and supply chain management, are perpetually given access to the resources they need to perform at the highest level. Turbonomic has in fact been proven to not only assure performance for mission-critical applications, but also improve it by upwards of 37%.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Iâ€™ve included a whitepaper that might be of particular interest to you and your team: <a href="http://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_Empowering-Ecommerce-Against-Unpredictable-Demand.pdf" target="_blank" id="">Empowering E-Commerce against Unpredictable Demand</a></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">If you would be open to the conversation, I would welcome the opportunity to connect with you or another team member to discuss the information above and introduce you to Turbonomic. Are you available for an hour next Friday at 2pm CST?</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Best,</span>
