    <subject>Webinar Reminder: NetApp ONTAP and VMTurbo- Just a Few Days Left to Register</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I’m writing to invite you to join me for a live demonstration of VMTurbo Operations Manager with ONTAP cluster mode support. I’m looking forward to sharing with you the many ways this solution will enable you to help your customers scale out virtualization and assure workload application performance at the virtualization layer and underlying storage infrastructure.     

 In this session, my colleague Jim O’Donnell and I will address how this combined solution will enable NetApp customers achieve the following: 
 
 -Prevent I/O performance issues in NetApp environments 
 -Align virtualization and storage disk space management, including thin provisioning, deduplication and compression
 -Plan and enable the deployment of key initiatives such as VDI and IO-intensive applications 
 -Adopt advanced NetApp features including ONTAP cluster mode     

Sign up for the demo at your preferred time:
