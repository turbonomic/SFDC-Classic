Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


VMTurbo just released &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/?p=10092&gt; v4.5. We are extending our control system beyond the hypervisor into the converged fabric and deeper into storage.


 - Control modules for NetApp and Cisco UCS &lt;http://bit.ly/1lilXre&gt; that enable VMTurbo to calculate actions for these infrastructure components, such as provisioning new storage controllers, new ports, or spinning up a new blade – all automatically, all optimally. 


Attend our webinar to learn more:


 - Thursday, January 30th 8:00AM - 9:00AM http://bit.ly/1eKySg2
