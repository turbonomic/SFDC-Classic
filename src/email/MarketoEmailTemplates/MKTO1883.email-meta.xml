    <subject>VMTurbo Summer Deal Discount</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Partner}},
As a valued VMTurbo partner, we want to make you are aware of a great promotion we are running through the end of August. We’ve recently begun a campaign targeting E-Commerce and Consumer organizations across the United States, and are offering partners who introduce VMTurbo into an E-Commerce/Consumer account an additional 15% discount off their transfer price.
With the holiday season less than four months away, Black Friday planning is underway – making it the ideal time to present solutions that will improve the performance of their mission-critical applications, efficiency of their infrastructure and general peace of mind during their busiest time of the year.
To lock in this promotion, simply register your opportunity on the Partner Portal. &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/community/partner-portal]]&gt;
Thank you!
The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
