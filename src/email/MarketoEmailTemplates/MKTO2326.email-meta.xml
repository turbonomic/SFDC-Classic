When can we jump on a webex to discuss how we have been working with other RoundTower offices, the benefits your customers could see from the platform, and which accounts we should be working on together? Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
