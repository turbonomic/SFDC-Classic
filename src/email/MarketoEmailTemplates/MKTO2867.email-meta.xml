    <subject>Executive Networking Lunch Indianapolis: The Journey to Hybrid Cloud</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

I am reaching out to personally invite you to Turbonomic&apos;s upcoming executive networking lunch in Indianapolis on July 13th. 


With nearly three decades of experience in technology, I have had the distinct pleasure of witnessing the myriad ways in which IT has evolved over time, and how this evolution has both solved existing challenges and created new ones for the world&apos;s largest enterprises.

The pace of change we are witnessing today, however, is unparalleled. I hope you will join myself and a dozen of your fellow IT leaders in Indianapolis for lunch from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Capital Grille to discuss the innovation we are seeing in the marketplace today, and how we are embracing it within our own organizations. Attendees will also receive a home automation kit, consisting of either an Amazon Echo or a Nest Home Thermostat. 

If you would like to attend, please RSVP using this link &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-indianapolis]]&gt; by no later than noon 
today - we are closing registration this afternoon. 


I hope you have a safe and relaxing holiday weekend. 




Yours sincerely,
Bill
