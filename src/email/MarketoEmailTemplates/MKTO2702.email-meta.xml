I wanted to let you know that we are running a special promotion for meeting with us over the next month. If you complete an introductory meeting with Turbonomic before June 23rd, we will enter you in a raffle to win an all-expenses paid trip for two (2) to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game in Miami, Florida from July 9 - 12, 2017. I know you and Tim reviewed the platform back in 2015 but was hoping to show you what is new with not only our on premise infrastructure optimization tool but also our new capabilities with hybrid cloud management. With our new 5.9 release we now have a new HTML UI design and the ability to help our customers be the most cost efficient as they move workloads to a public cloud environment.   We’d like to show you how - and give you an opportunity to watch the best baseball players in the league come together for an unforgettable event.  If you’d like to be entered, you can visit this page &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jE1TcMTPLVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhPBE%2DzVD%2DxiKTUfZRud7V%2DyY9k%2D73jzWkB943El0TYG05TbUVdfAC1R6YZ1jHsAKQKDS6d%5FiPDAqEzng8Ejo0w0cOSSZqj1Vej7Gjywj2jEHRpyuWT42aPXM1Qv%2DZUk3UW4mk8R%2DvMxBiV75sLpQgipfVZhzE88NtIOcs6sEqIUwL33rfVWuw8TqaLwrumjdUbPh06oZMsdjfFKGyeGrPKIDZ32T3drzg3aA1GECljBLY7kELUrUJDVcEMSBKtmjABzG0s5K9d%2DYH0mArARUnjHQL8hges%5FlySIYIL4FyrrI4szAuKbF6ouak%2C/j09SdsDLK1lNoVdlsbPWJbvomjvDc4qrt7kzH%5Fryx9081gZ9feGAPVn7jcFfHZ5%5FaeCQCkwaAIBgnxlKFr2daJRQ6bAOKgTgfn6tprXPfY9Bf7t%2D1cIv%5FKeonTIjp9GA313ABQIdVHB%2DKQOFeboyjTjpM5VuWAqR%5F3rWNJ5mzg5OiLYQ6Yakdu7m40aB3n7MzzS4YWlpwdWC%2DlqPD7VGjYcXpXEG7AR1cPbk6zr%2Dl%2D4IvA0NwP9upClI3%5F1%2DFc4tszfMDQA%2C]]&gt;, or just let me know and I will work with you directly to schedule our meeting and put you into the raffle.    Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   Going to Cisco Live?
