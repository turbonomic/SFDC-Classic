Subject: Turbonomic: Coordinating Next Discussion  Denise, Good afternoon! I wanted to reach out to see if you had any questions/concerns as you are going through the platform on your own that an engineer or I can answer.  For next week, is there a time where we could set up a call with you, Stephen and some of the other engineers to walk through the platform’s full capabilities? I want to make sure we are able to show not only our ability to help around performance but also capacity planning as well as I know that was an area of high interest.  Currently our Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons are wide open after 1pm EST. Let me know what is best for you.  Best, James This message and its attachments are intended only for the designated recipient(s).
