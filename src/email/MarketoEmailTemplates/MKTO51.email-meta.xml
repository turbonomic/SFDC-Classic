Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for your interest in VMTurbo Operations Manager Community Edition. Getting started with this solution is just a few clicks (and less than 30 minutes) away. Visit VMTurbo’s website to initiate your download &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/getting-started/&gt;.
 
Use your license key &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/CommunityEditionDownload_License14978235.html&gt; to enable the features in the Community Edition. Once you’ve installed and configured the VMTurbo appliance in your environment, check out the evaluation resources &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/resources/evaluation-resource-center/&gt; available and, of course, you can always reach support &lt;http://support.vmturbo.com/home&gt; 
for assistance.
 
Finally, if you have a few minutes (specifically, 2 minutes and 24 seconds), we invite you to view a fun introductory video &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/vmtvideo/&gt; about VMTurbo. We look forward to working with you.
