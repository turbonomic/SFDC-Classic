Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Containers are not new. In fact, their conceptual lineage dates back to the 1970s and chroot jail in UNIX, wherein an application&apos;s processes and dependencies were isolated from the rest of the system.
In 2014, the genesis of Docker catapulted containers back into the spotlight, as a prospective and seemingly inevitable replacement for their heavier cousins, virtual machines.
As organizations experiment and eventually transition to technologies such as containers and microservices they will inevitably encounter a new set of challenges â€“ This Thursday we&apos;ll discuss all these and more on our webinar Containers, Microservices &amp; Why They Matter.
During the webinar, we cover:



 - 
Which container standard is winning, and which alternatives you should consider


 - 
How containerization and microservices will impact performance through increased East-West traffic


 - 
How microservices trade code complexity for operational complexity, and why you should care


 - 
What VMTurbo is doing to deliver performance control in virtualized, containerized and microservices environments alike
