Let me know if you would like to take a quick look at what Turbonomic can do.  Best regards, James From: James Wilcox

Subject: Turbonomic Conversation Follow Up  Bill – Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I wanted to follow up our call with some information about how Turbonomic is different from the VSuite of tools and does what VMWare’s VRops and VSphere &lt;[[https://vmturbo.wistia.com/medias/r67l1kk7i5]]&gt; can’t to allow our customers to prevent problems from ever entering their environment.  Typically teams run into three separate questions when continuing to virtualize within their infrastructure:  ·         Are the virtual machines properly sized and placed within the infrastructure so we know the applications are getting the right resources they need in order to run optimally? ·         Do we have enough capacity within our existing infrastructure to onboard X numbers of virtual machines? ·         Are the virtual machines onboard and sized properly? And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications?  Turbonomic answers all these questions for you and your infrastructure team as well as help you plan for any workloads you are looking to onboard to Azure or AWS public cloud. This allows for our customers to increase operational efficiency as alerts decrease by 80% and increase infrastructure efficiency while still assuring application performance.  Autonomic Platform for AWS &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-for-AWS-Data-Sheet.pdf]]&gt; One thing that I failed to mention is that we recently launched our Infrastructure Optimization Survey &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/m000Zg10g0cg9gZyIe00ZH0]]&gt;, and are offering a $25 Amazon gift card for completing the 5 minute survey by April 1st. We are also offering $100 Amazon gift card for agreeing to a 30 minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer (meeting must complete by April 15th). If at the end of the meeting, you choose to engage in a proof of value, we will donate $1,000 to the 501(c)(3) charity of your choosing. Let me know if you would like to see how Turbonomic can be beneficial for you and the team at Universal Orlando and I would be happy to set up a 30 minute demonstration. Best regards, James</textOnly>
