Highlight: Turbofest London

 


 
On March 19th, we hosted our third Turbofest in London, UK. The event was held at the Andaz Hotel with the cocktail hour taking place in their stunning Neoclassic Temple Room (pictured above). Because of the great customer speakers and a growing crowd, which eventually became standing room only, we are currently planning our next Turbofest event in Atlanta, GA on June 17th.
