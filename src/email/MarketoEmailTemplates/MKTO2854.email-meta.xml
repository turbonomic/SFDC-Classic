I know you mentioned you have the VMware suite of tools but I was hoping to introduce you how we are the only platform that allows our customers to assure performance through our different approach and save thousands on infrastructure costs.  Turbonomic’s control platform allows infrastructure teams continue to grow out and scale their on-premise infrastructure by using automation to ensure that each workload is getting the resources it needs in real time, while also giving you cost insight into your public cloud investments. With the 5.9 release, Turbonomic can help you break down which templates are the most cost effective for spinning up workloads in a public cloud like AWS or Azure.  Our customers use the automation to not only increase workload performance, but to also increase the efficiency of their infrastructure. Because of this they are able to spend significantly less on hardware year over year.  BMC CIO, Scott Crowder Talks Turbonomic - Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; From what I know about the complexity of Broward County’s infrastructure, I am confident you will find our product valuable.

Subject: Turbonomic conversation follow up Hi Del, We just spoke on the phone briefly but it seems the call dropped. I understand that you most likely have some tools in place for managing your virtual environment as this is the case for most of our customers. The reason that our customers choose to implement Turbonomic is because of our ability to allow them to increase application performance while also increasing infrastructure efficiency through our intelligent automation.  Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; From this, our customers are able to defer hardware out of their infrastructure and continue to scale at the lowest cost to the business possible. What I was hoping to do is line up a 15-30 minute introductory where I can provide a high level overview and see if it would be something that would be beneficial to you and the team at Broward County.  Do you have any time over the next couple of weeks for an introduction?   James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jEtUdMXGKlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhZA0CgSD7toKPIYJpPY7A909Nmub2s3D1V7Niahk7NVGI6bWlqTCiEUO0sjw3TGcIORQff%2DEznJYUEkCM4sZhX%2D7andIm53XqMwmrLwgGJIH9a0s2hyQ20IoNDgfs1vBUd3HF0UsTX9AzN8%2D4LinYi2%2DZa3hpIzOVwcpkx4R6vSh7byZr8HeR9e%2DfrxNPajqwqYjQhiYh3b2%5FmBE6KXdOMfwpfoCqBmWwOGQ13Hz0DHO18wwC8pFlQdblbFBqMsjMa%5FF0x1%5FoN2bP16DyTTyG5FgjItk3tjUk%2C/j0lWecHGLllNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwt0x3V19ZqOQNUr7t8deF89gfdy%5FKjgaMJYwzDVIS%2DSPOdJi%5FuxfJmqwDjX2hoT0RYgYZ5pK5Pg0rYWw81YwucSrp3vlCEM7RzQ%5FQEPOTfwsiyriIt0qUQWV%2D2jVJ5IgiD0agPAH2YG%5Fbg%2C%2C]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jEtUdMXGKlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhZA0CgSD7toKPIYJpPY7A909Nmub2s3D1V7Niahk7NVGI6bWlqTCiEUO0sjw3TGcIORQff%2DEznJYUEkCM4sZhX%2D7andIm53XqMwmrLwgGJIH9a0s2hyQ20IoNDgfs1vBUd3HF0UsTX9AzN8%2D4LinYi2%2DZa3hpIzOVwcpkx4R6vSh7byZr8HeR9e%2DfrxNPajqwqYjQhiYh3b2%5FmBE6KXdOMfwpfoCqBmWwOGQ13Hz0DHO18wwC8pFlQdblbFBqMsjMa%5FF0x1%5FoN2bP16DyTTyG5FgjItk3tjUk%2C/h0xUcMDNdlBQuVN5sfaYL6z%2D0SLJdpuno5xpHOXk3cEx1EF9PO%5FANR7ig8duCJ05OLuGNCM7KZpCxl1UI%5FDEeJoFqNdZEkOfczmpjqjcSqNkdOJl8vhZxv339XUunOiRi3X5LmYPTERrIVW5LOwE]]&gt;   Going to Cisco Live?
