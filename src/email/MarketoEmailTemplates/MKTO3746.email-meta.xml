    <subject>You&apos;re Invited - Atlanta Turbonomic User Group</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=friend}},
 
I hope you are doing well and enjoying your spring. As we approach June, I want to personally extend an invitation to our upcoming user group meeting in Atlanta taking place Monday, June 11th.
 
If you aren&apos;t familiar with the Atlanta Turbonomic User Group, we are a customer-led community, serving as a place for IT professionals to network, share best practices and engage in constructive 
conversations on cutting edge technology trends. We are a community who loves to learn, and I hope you will join us in that journey!
 
I&apos;m pleased to be hosting the next meeting at the Travelport offices-- located at 300 Galleria Parkway Northwest. We&apos;ll have a full schedule of working sessions and technology roadmap discussions, and of course, lunch and refreshments will be provided.
 
RSVP today &lt;[[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/atlanta-turbonomic-user-group-tickets-44746324461]]&gt;, and I hope to see you there!

Best,
Steve Senecal
