“Virtualization without rightsizing is antithetical to virtualization technology”
Properly and continually rightsizing virtual machines remains one of the greatest challenges for administrators (and greatest limitations of traditional operations managers) in virtualization today. Virtualization without rightsizing is antithetical to the technology, and at scale, degrades the efficiencies garnered by virtualizing in the first place. Improperly-sized VMs erode healthy densities, and mimic (in software) the hardware overprovisioning that virtualization aimed to curb. Guess-and-check at the VM level is insufficient; in aggregate, this method creates significant waste.

This whitepaper explores the challenges of workload rightsizing, and how a systemic (rather than elemental) approach to rightsizing can help you increase VM densities by up to 40%. You were smart for virtualizing. Now, be brilliant about it.
