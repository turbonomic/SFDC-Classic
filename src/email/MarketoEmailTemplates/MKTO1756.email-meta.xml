It is my pleasure to cordially invite you to VMTurbo&apos;s first Turbofest Chicago! This afternoon event will be held Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 at OFFSITE &lt;[[http://chicago.gooffsite.com/]]&gt; Chicago. Presentations will run from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM with time for networking - followed by an evening at U.S. Cellular Field for the White Sox vs. Tigers game. 
Limited to the first 100 VIP registrants, Turbofest Chicago will feature an evening of baseball and refreshments, after a day of cloud and virtualization thought leadership.
You can register here &lt;[[http://vmturbo.com/turbofest-chicago/?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=TurbofestChicago&amp;utm_content=20160413]]&gt;, for this invitation-only event, and a VMTurbo representative will contact you to address any question you may have. I look forward to seeing you there.
