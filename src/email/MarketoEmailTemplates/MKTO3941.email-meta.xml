    <textOnly>August Was Made for No Socks
“Right away Turbonomic had my socks blown off… it did the whole thing for you.…We have definitely been on a journey to hybrid cloud and we could not have done it without Turbonomic.” 
– John Belcher, Principal Infrastructure Engineer, MetroStar Systems

Have you heard? Turbonomic is for any cloud—hybrid cloud, multicloud, your cloud, the other guy’s cloud... So, we’re thrilled to share MetroStar’s story where making workloads SMART (self-managing, anywhere, in real-time) is helping them on their cloud journey. And what perfect timing too, because who needs socks in August. 

By automating Turbonomic AWS storage tier optimization recommendations, they were able to ensure performant workloads, while reducing their monthly spend by 25% and freeing their teams from babysitting dashboards.
