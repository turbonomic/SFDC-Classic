Because of this I thought it would make sense for us to connect to introduce you to Turbonomic Rather than a typical elemental tool, our platform operates as a single-pane of glass driving real-time automatable decisions for all the leading on premise hypervisors and across all the major public cloud providers. Not to mention, we have out-of-the box capability to plug into all layers of your environment from applications down to storage in order to prevent the ripple effects that can come from making disjointed decisions in the software-defined data center. Cisco, Verizon, HPE &amp; BMC  have seen a: 
	- 37% increase in application performance 	- 40% increase in VM/host density 	- 80% decrease in troubleshooting and ticketing

Are you available for a conversation second week of may?  Best, Kathleen NorchiSales, East440-708-8477 </textOnly>
