&quot;Turbonomic is absolutely one of our mission-critical tools, and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone - on- premises in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment. It saves us thousands of dollars in the cloud every month.&quot; - John Belcher, Principal Infrastructure Engineer at Metrostar
