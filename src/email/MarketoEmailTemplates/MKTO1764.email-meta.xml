Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

You are a professional, however, you are struggling to overcome the shortfalls of amateur tools that lead to over-provisioning or resource shortfalls in the virtual datacenter. This adds cost and complexity that challenges your ability to grow your virtualization and cloud environments.    

 Download this complimentary whitepaper http://bit.ly/1iRVqdK to find out how you can increase resource utilization and staff productivity by 20%, reduce operational expense, and defer IT infrastructure spend until you absolutely need it. You’ll learn about a new approach to virtualization management that deploys intelligent workload management to optimize configurations and maximize resource efficiency, preventing performance risks from manifesting, giving you, the professional, the control.    

 Sincerely, 
 VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
