    <subject>Join us for a Brewery Tour and Pints at Austin Beerworks</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}!
 


Enjoy a cold one with 
the best and the brightest of Austin&apos;s IT community at Austin Beerworks on Thursday, April 11th. Join Freeit, Turbonomic, and HPE for a laid-back private brewery tour along with pints and delicious bites. 
 
During the event, we&apos;ll be available to discuss how you can optimize your storage. If you don&apos;t want to talk shop, that&apos;s fine, come by anyway and enjoy a pint on us!


Register here! &lt;[[https://www.freeitdata.com/events/4-11-abw-austin/]]&gt;
 
Want to bring a friend? Do it! We&apos;d love to meet them! Feel free to pass these details along. RSVP to secure your spot today!


Sincerely,
Team 
Turbonomic
