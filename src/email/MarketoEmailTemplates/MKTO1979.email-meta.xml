Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

IT budgeting is no easy feat. Whether you&apos;re a small shop and wearing many hats, or a large matrix organization across many projects, the administrative time it takes to create, organize and complete an annual operating budget is a significant waste.
We&apos;ve worked with our very own customers to design this simple and intuitive 3-Year IT Budget Template for all the reasons above. This budget template, built in Microsoft Excel, includes five budgeting tabs and a 3-Year rollup tab enabling you to quickly and easily track and project:



	- 

Operating Costs

	- 

Software &amp; Licensing Costs

	- 

Hardware Costs

	- 

System Build Cost Comparisons

	- 

and all of those special projects
