Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
Mission-critical applications, such as e-commerce sites and financial transaction systems, have strict SLAs when it comes to performance. Turbonomic enables users to define QoS levels for any application. The software then continuously controls the environment in a state of health, delivering on specified QoS levels, so you meet those SLAs and keep end-users satisfied.
When QoS goals are defined for applications, for examples 500 ms latency or 1,000 transactions per minute, Turbonomic applies its market abstraction to take care of the rest. QoS levels are simply another dimension that Turbonomic uses to refine an environment’s Desired State.
Are you ready to see all that Turbonomic has to offer you? Give the free trial a shot &lt;[[http://turbonomic.com/downloads/turbonomic-30-day-trial/?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ENG-QOS&amp;utm_content=Early04]]&gt; and see just how Turbonomic will drive your environment to perpetual health.
