Please don’t hesitate to reach out to Steve or I if you have any questions.  I know during the call we discussed having another meeting to ensure you and the team get a rundown of the capacity planner’s capabilities. Do you have any time later this week or early next week to hop on a quick call for us to run through that aspect with you and the team?  Best, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   </textOnly>
