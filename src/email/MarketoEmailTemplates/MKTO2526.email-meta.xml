    <textOnly>Hi Vanessa- To follow up on our previous reach out, I wanted to send you a recording to our Healthcare Best Practices webinar with Colorado Children&apos;s Hospital &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/thx-wbnr-recrd-best-practices-for-healthcare-data-centers/]]&gt;. I think this webinar aligns particularly well with your area of focus and expertise as a Manager for Palmetto. 
 	- The unique challenges healthcare providers face in ensuring continuous availability of mission critical applications 	- The challenges of deploying and virtualizing Electronic Medical Record systems and VDI instances 	- How Children’s Hospital Colorado leverages Turbonomic to eliminate resource contention, maximize uptime and maintain a healthy data center 
 If you would rather read, I suggest you take a look at the Turbonomic ROI Whitepaper &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_ROI.pdf]]&gt;. As someone with a more strategic, business-oriented vantage point, I think you’ll find that it resonates.  I&apos;ll follow up with a phone call on later this week to hear your thoughts – looking forward to speaking with you then!  Best,
