{{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, A key goal when planning and operating a VDI environment is to ensure that end users receive performance comparable to that of a physical desktop. This requires that the underlying virtual infrastructure has resources appropriately allocated at all times. This becomes especially difficult when you take into account the unpredictable nature of VDI environments. I/O intensive tasks such as Boot storms, patching and anti-virus can place heavy demand on the underlying infrastructure resulting in potential outages.  Find out to prevent I/O contention in your VDI deployment below!  &lt;[[http://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/io-intensive-tasks-in-vdi-environment/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ENG-VDI&amp;utm_content=Early03]]&gt; - The Turbonomic Team</textOnly>
