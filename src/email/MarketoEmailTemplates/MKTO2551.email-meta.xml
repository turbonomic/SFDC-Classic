Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},



Are you going to Citrix Synergy in Orlando, FL? If so, we’d love to meet you! You can find a number of Turbonomic representatives at booth 509, showcasing our partnership with Citrix to assure VDI performance and improve hybrid cloud management.
 
With Turbonomic and Citrix, you’re able to:


	- Assure XenServer and XenDesktop workload performance
	- Maximize utilization of your cloud or virtual environment
	-  Automate bounding of cloned application instances with the NetScaler load balancer in private and hybrid clouds


 Don’t just take our word for it -- stop by our booth to see it for yourself. And if you can’t make it to the conference, you can access information on Turbonomic’s support for VDI &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/downloads/turbonomic-vdi-trial/]]&gt;, as well as download a free 30-day trial on our website.
 
Hope to see you in Orlando!
 
Best,
- The Turbonomic Team</textOnly>
