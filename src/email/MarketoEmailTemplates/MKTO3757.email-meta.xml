    <subject>Upgrade to Turbonomic 6.1 for Application-Aware Workload Automation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

With our recent launch of Turbonomic 6.1 we’ve hit a major milestone: application-aware SMART (Self-Managing, Anywhere, in Real-Time) workload automation for hybrid and multicloud infrastructure. That being said, I want to ensure you understand and leverage all the new functionality that’s available to you when you upgrade to Turbonomic 6.1 &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/introducing-turbonomic-6-1/6-1-highlight-reel]]&gt;.

If you haven’t already upgraded or spoken with a member of 
the Turbonomic team, I’d like to offer you a free assessment of your environment through the lens of 6.1, walking your team through our improved product functionality, so you can benefit from:



	- Maximized Reserved Instance Utilization in AWS – Many AWS customers struggle to maximize reserved instance capacity across their estate.
