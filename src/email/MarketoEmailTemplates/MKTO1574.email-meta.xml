Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
Organizations are moving towards OpenStack cloud for the promise of no vendor lock-in, IT agility, and competitive differentiation. This movement is part of a larger shift away from rigid, heavy IT to demanding technologies that enable them to build exactly what they want, when they want it.
Out of the box, OpenStack’s cloud infrastructure cannot accommodate application demands in real-time. VMTurbo’s Demand-Driven Control seamlessly integrates with OpenStack to keep the cloud environment in its Desired State—continuously assuring application performance, while maximizing infrastructure utilization.
