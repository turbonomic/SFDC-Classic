    <subject>Live Demo: RI Optimization in AWS</subject>

Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

By investing in AWS Reserved Instances you have the best intentions to shrink your cloud bill, but then you don&apos;t use what you&apos;ve paid for and the guilt sets in - like that unused gym membership. It doesn&apos;t have to be this way; we have your back.

 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/reserved-instances-aws/]]&gt;

Join this live demo on September 19 at 11 a.m. ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/reserved-instances-aws/]]&gt; to see how software can accurately and continuously apply RIs, so you get all the cost benefits and none of the guilt with Turbonomic RI optimization in AWS.




Regards,
Megan
