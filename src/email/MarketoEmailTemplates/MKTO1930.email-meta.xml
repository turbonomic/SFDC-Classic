Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Turbonomic automatically identifies over-sized EC2 instances and makes specific downsize recommendations to save you time and money without sacrificing application performance.

 The platform continuously analyzes the resources your applications are consuming and provides you with decisions and data you can rely on for instance sizing, provisioning and placement.
With automatable decisions you’ll spend less time worrying about the performance of your apps and run-away bills and more time building and deploying your applications. 
One Turbonomic instance can target up to 10,000 EC2 instances, as well as other public cloud providers or virtual machines in your private data center.
