Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for your recent inquiry. We experienced website issues in the earlier part of this week that may have prevented you from successfully downloading a VMTurbo Operations Manager 30-day trial. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

If you were affected by the outage, please revisit our site &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/Cloud_Edition_Download_Appliance_Download.html&gt; to continue with the download and license activation process. As an alternative to running an evaluation yourself, we can remotely demonstrate our solution’s capabilities. Please contact us &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/request-a-demo.html?source=email&gt; if you would like to set that up.

We look forward to working with you regarding your next steps implementing VMTurbo’s control system for virtual infrastructure that ensures consistent service delivery and reduces the capital and operational costs of running virtual data centers.
Best regards,

{{lead.Lead Owner First Name:default=The VMTurbo Team}} {{lead.Lead Owner Last Name:default=edit me}}
