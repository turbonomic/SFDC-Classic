This requirement might seem as if it’s in direct contrast to delivering the highest quality IT services to students, faculty and staff. What if I told you it didn’t have to be? I&apos;d love to learn more about your current approach to these challenges, and share how we’ve helped organizations like Austin ISD and Midway ISD overcome them. Below are the truly compelling results we have driven across all our Education customers:   Would you be open to a conversation at 2pm CST tomorrow, or at 10am CST this Thursday 4/27.  If this week is busy we could shoot for a time next week when you have 30 minutes of free time. I look forward to hearing your thoughts either way. Best, Andrew  From: Andrew Hanlon

Subject: RE: Turbonomic - Refresher Good Afternoon, Brian I hope you had a great weekend!  I wanted to bring this back to the top of your inbox, in case you missed my note. Do you have 30 minutes or so to catch up later on this week?  Best,Andrew   From: Andrew Hanlon

Subject: Turbonomic - Refresher Hey Brian, I have tried to reach you a few times with no luck and have spoken with Amanda.   Reason I am reaching out is to set aside 30 minutes when you are free next week to give you a refresher on Turbonomic, knowing that you loved the technology last time you took a look, but you could not live with the price. Good news is that we have enhanced the technology and have many more integrations to all levels of the stack, as well a new workload pricing model that we can be very flexible with. I would love to set time up to discuss this and simply explore if we would align, take it from there if it’s something you want to move forward with after 30 minutes. Thank you and let me know what you think. Best,Andrew Andrew Hanlon | TurbonomicCommercial Accounts - Dallas | c: 617.834.5514 | o: 857.305.5840  </textOnly>
