Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

VMTurbo has just released a whitepaper that contains insights on how to address the most critical challenge IT leaders face when trying to deliver application performance--how to manage resource contention in the underlying storage infrastructure.

 - Reduce ongoing storage infrastructure costs by 20-30%
 - Significantly reduce operational costs by preventing complex storage problems  and their impact on workloads, and, in turn, on end users 
 - Ensure application performance and reduce risk 
 - Enable IO-intensive applications to be virtualized reliably, bringing down the  overall cost to deliver compute services to the business and customers
