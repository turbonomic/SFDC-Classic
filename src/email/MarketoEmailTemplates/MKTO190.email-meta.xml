Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thanks for stopping by our booth at the Microsoft Management Summit last week. We enjoyed learning about your plans to create a private cloud based on Microsoft technologies, or migrate workloads from vSphere to Hyper-V, or get greater control over the management challenges that virtualization and cloud deployments have introduced.

We can help. Our Operations Manager solution allows you to intelligently plan, deploy and control virtual data centers and cloud environments. It focuses on ensuring performance of workloads while maximizing the utilization of your virtual infrastructure. It integrates with Microsoft System Center, providing you with a single lens for controlling workloads and resources. And it can also save licensing costs when moving portions of your infrastructure from vSphere to Hyper-V.

To learn more, get a quick-and-easy glimpse &lt;http://bit.ly/10cctnM&gt; into how we can help you control your cloud and virtualized environments or download a 30-day trial &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; and take it for a spin. Our virtual appliance is easily downloaded and configured, and will provide value in less than 30 minutes.

We will be following up with you shortly to understand your priorities and interest in learning more about VMTurbo. We look forward to speaking with you.

Thanks,

The VMTurbo Team
