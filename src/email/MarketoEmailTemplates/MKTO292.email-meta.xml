    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

At VMTurbo, weâ€™re seeing many organizations like yours concentrating efforts on trying to increase utilization of their existing server and storage infrastructures to prepare for projects upcoming in the new year.  Over 80% of our customers have indicated they were able to increase resource utilization by more than 20%, while almost two thirds saw this value within 15 business days.  

I&apos;d like to offer you a no-cost assessment that will show you how our software can deliver immediate value toward your year-end goals and help you defer IT spend into 2014. Please reply to this message with the day and time that works best for you for a 10 minute call. 

Sincerely,
{{lead.Lead Owner First Name:default=edit me}} {{lead.Lead Owner Last Name:default=edit me}}
