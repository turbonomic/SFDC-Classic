Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
As organizations scale, planning for greater application workload demand is critical. IT cannot afford to be seen as a bottleneck to successful business growth.
Ensuring that your data center is meeting the demands of your applications is critical to business growth, all the more so as your business scales into 2016! Don&apos;t be that guy (or girl) that&apos;s stalling exciting growth and opportunity. Be the person that&apos;s always got a plan for driving even more success.

 - Memory Swapping
