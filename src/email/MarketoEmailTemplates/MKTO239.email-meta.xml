Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for registering to our Jumpstart Training session tomorrow at 12pm ET.

I am excited to spend about 1.5 hours with you to introduce you to the breakthrough technology that drives VMTurbo Operations Manager, and demonstrate how it assures application performance while utilizing virtualized and cloud infrastructure resources as efficiently as possible.

If you have any questions in advance or after the webinar please feel free to send us an email at education@vmturbo.com.

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!

Best Regards

Orna Kliger, Director of Educational Services</textOnly>
