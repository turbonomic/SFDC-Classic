	- Are the virtual machines properly sized and placed within the infrastructure so we know the applications are getting the right resources they need in order to run optimally? 	- Do we have enough capacity within our existing infrastructure to onboard X numbers of virtual machines? 	- Are the virtual machines onboard and sized properly? And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications? 
 Turbonomic has direct ties with both VMware and NetApp and answers all these questions  for you and your infrastructure team with no human intervention as well as help you plan for any workloads you are looking to onboard to Azure or AWS public cloud. This allows for our customers to increase operational efficiency as alerts decrease by 80% and increase infrastructure efficiency while still assuring application performance.  Autonomic Platform for AWS &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jEFVdcDII1xQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhZA0CkWTexhKDXboNHcJR6zshl9r2olmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXbw6ghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYez4166%5FU%5F%5F5h%2DCGGVf7O6830iSKKByos5R6nspxlsKSdmmzi%5Fhz5ICmHQW0sJ8tC8%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DPOQbxDmjjypZesEYRC3tjCgU6WgYh%5FFM2oTOqCzDTijrCHnriDeR3Q2HMZcG21bDmPsv4i7aPRrq19lrU2KtWM%5Fnnl6yFMTKgnZhRdVuc9MQeYCb4NnszNYxgSvuARGYxv6gGUFqdeM%2C/jU1ScMfJKVlNoVdlsbPWN7vhmzDGf5a7vvJtG%5Fjp1N8x0EZqPO%5FANQ752pxEDp5tcLSWFRYAAN0y4TNnDvWHfo9O9fhUCA%2DxVzbAl7GXPalNfrpn2c91wL211G8Ers69pkneC0AAT3xlZ0vPTbkvlnC1FLEUbE7V3l%5FAIYZuzgw7jbgBwty7ebXy%2Dn6wrkCbyCKjEnB6osCW%2Dge%5FUaw6vIc5lWAJ4HUtQtimxBTg2J8J%5Fhd99OFn1g4y8d9fbcxA8RywXz3U95byHd9%2DSISiia%5FqqKUfSREBuI8cXkaCOEGdMJq%2DemRw%5FAPXm2g9IwE3FiVwA%5FUrxwTIn3VReMAZFRmQyzwhx0ssgIBd%2DaPKvyCEJXryaDGm5xGm21SzdNIP8HGozd1zxBrVIjbm9uBMAHGgCaSMhEKbYIXukBAhQ8VbbJAeI7CI7v37xdks%5FCCJcE2f0M%2DFERdxYb02hfinks%2D4%2DdiPvjnu2VxvjBR5cTdx6Cv9ebnbASsxpbyLu%2DyzidWy6nQQ%5FFpOIxYHtg3ka90R1wn0]]&gt; Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks to jump on a conference bridge with an engineer and myself to learn more and see if it can have some of the same benefits for you and the team at Blackboard? Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
