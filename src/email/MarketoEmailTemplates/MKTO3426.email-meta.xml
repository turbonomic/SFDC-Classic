Hi {{Lead.First Name}},


As Spectre/Meltdown continues to cause problems for IT departments, it is becoming clear that enterprises heavily reliant on Windows opereating systems  &lt;[[http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/security/spectre-meltdown-hit-prem-windows-servers-hardest]]&gt;are expereincing the greatest performance impact.

The scope of the problem underscores the need for automated patching, as traditional hand-to-hand processes cannot deal with performance and operational tasks at scale.

At Turbonomic we help our customers understand the implications these patches will have for your application performance. 



Join us on Wednesday, January 31 at 1PM ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/spectre-and-meltdown-webinar/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=spectre_meltdown_webinar]]&gt; as we discuss how to mitigate the performance impact of Spectre and Meltdown.
