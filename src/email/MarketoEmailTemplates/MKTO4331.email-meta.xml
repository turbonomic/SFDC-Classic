Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

When it comes down to cloud providers, which should you choose? It should be a straightforward question, but when you need a detailed justification for the CIO, the CFO, and the board, you need more than just a hunch. 

Let&apos;s find out together. Take our NEW Which Cloud Survey &lt;[[http://bit.ly/2T9BmxI]]&gt; to help establish a baseline on where organizations like yours are in their public cloud journeys and identify which cloud providers are winning in the race towards adoption.



Take Survey Now &lt;[[http://bit.ly/2T9BmxI]]&gt;



This survey will take approximately 3 minutes to complete. As a thank you for your time, you will earn a free coffee with a £5 Starbucks voucher upon completion of the survey.

Regards,
