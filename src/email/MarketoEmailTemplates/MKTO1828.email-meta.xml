    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
We were honoured to host Turbofest London last week with a full room and a packed speaking agenda. Thank you for joining us and making the event such a great success!
Be sure to keep an eye out for the Turbofest recordings which we will be sharing within the next week.

Best,
