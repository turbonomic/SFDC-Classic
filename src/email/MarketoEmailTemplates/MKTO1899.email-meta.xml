    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=}},
Remember that time when you signed up on our site because you really wanted a TurboStack Home Lab or free full conference passes to VMworld 2016? But despite your best efforts these prizes eluded you and all you were left with were our emails? 
Well, for all of those things we’re really sorry. We’d like to make it up to you.
As you know, we will be giving away top dollar swag at our VMworld booth (1139) this year. Things like a TurboStack Home Lab, an Oculus Rift and more. All you have to do is join our Green Circle Community, complete missions to earn points, then cash those points in at our booth.
Your first mission? Login to the Green Circle Community now to enter to win a BB-8 Sphero Droid.
