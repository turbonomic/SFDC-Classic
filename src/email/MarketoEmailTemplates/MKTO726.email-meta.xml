    <subject>Whitepaper: Maximize Your vCloud Director Lifecycle</subject>
    <textOnly>Whether you&apos;re a SP running vCD, or an Enterprise who purchased before the split, vCloud Director has a lot of fight left.
VMware&apos;s 2013 announcement &lt;http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2013/09/vcloud-director-convergence-and-transition-plan-whats-the-scoop.html&gt; of vCloud Director&apos;s fusion with vCAC and vSphere left many purchasers puzzled: why was I sold this tool that I now have to trade-in (and pay-up) for a newer model with less functionality?

vCloud Director created tremendous potential for Service Providers and Enterprises to deliver agile and cost effective Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to clients. Its dismantling among enterprises was a blow to many organizations.

Good news: vCD has a lot of fight left. Read this whitepaper and learn how to maximize return on your investment in vCloud Director &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/wp-reducing-costs-in-vcloud-environments.html?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=vcd&gt;.
