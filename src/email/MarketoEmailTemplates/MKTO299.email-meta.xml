    <subject>JPMorgan Chase on Virtualization Management</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

VMTurbo was recently honored by JPMorgan Chase as the latest in a very elite group to be inducted into the Innovation Hall of Fame http://bit.ly/1cDmdJY. A recent survey revealed that 89% of our customer realized value within just 3 months of deployment.      

You’re probably wondering, OK, but what does this mean for me? With VMTurbo, you can take control of your virtualized environment, maintaining consistent application workload performance as you scale out cloud and virtualization infrastructures.      

As a result of our innovation, you can achieve 20-40% reduction in IT spend and increased operational efficiency, freeing up your most valuable technical resources.

 “…VMTurbo’s technology is helping JPMorgan Chase optimize the utilization of virtual environments, supporting a move from reactive to predictive workload management. Automation will enable our support teams to focus on higher value activity, dynamically optimizing virtual environments.”    

 Sincerely,
The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
