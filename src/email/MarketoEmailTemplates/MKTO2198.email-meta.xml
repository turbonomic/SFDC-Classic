With Turbonomic you are enabled to extend your private cloud management approach to:  ·         Burst workload into the cloud when demand increases and cannot be met with local resources·         Maintain control on workload performance and resource utilization to decide when to move workloads back on-premises ·         Allow applications to auto-scale and clone into the cloud ·         Load balance across private and public clouds EDF Delivers the Hybrid Cloud &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/videos/turbonomic-customer-success-story-edf-re-delivering-cloud/]]&gt; Dan, do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction/educational overview to Turbonomic and see where we can align with you and the team at the Advisory Board Company? Best, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   From: James Wilcox

Subject: Dan - Controlling costs of both on premise and public cloud investments Dan – With a hybrid cloud environment I know it can be difficult to not overspend on template sizes for the public cloud while still trying to maintain and optimize an on premise infrastructure as well. It’s a lot to manage.  As you know, with all the SAAS offerings that The Advisory Board Company offers to its customers, it is important to be agile and you must be able to spin up VMs quickly to the DevOps team which is why I assume you and the team chose to go with AWS to support the non-legacy applications. What I’d like to show you is how Turbonomic allows for our customers to spend less on template sizing in the cloud, while still assuring the performance and increasing the efficiency of their on-premise environment.  Autonomic Platform for AWS &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jEBTdc3HKlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhVBE29UDrxhIHba5tHYrthxY9i8KXjzWkB943El0TYG05TbUVVMQC1R6YZ1jHsAKQKDS6d%5FiPDAqEzng8Ejo0z78aRcIKs1leRp2jxwS2hA2BpyuWuu3KPXMxQke0Mk3UBuX0RW%2DvPsQCS74gcsR8IpfVZhzE88NtIOcs6sEqIUwL33rfVWuw8TqaLwrumjdUbPh06oZMsdjfFKGyeGrPKIDZ32T3drzg3aAlJACVzKr8po0LcqH9yXf0MYTikmiQgw1ZzjLJd9qT%5Fs32ob0HnZnD%5FgjK9yQaCPoIP9GCTo%5FEszA3xJDnN3fhnZm%2DyD8Hyq3fiXobJjHAzT8scD%5FoqBOaS%5FsiowPwR%2DniScAY%2C/j0pZdszNLFlNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpxd9z2kdwZunBLA76mN9eHZYhKt2LEwAfHZ9syQ8VHO%2DHMaF3ybh5ClWzFQj3haTOIZ1Kd%2Dt%2D19Ve66euhTIdn%5FypqFbvCh5bdmRnPVXIb7Z1rWu0Z5wqXTOG01PMIKsNixFd15AR%5FaSebqqdzlSJ9Ejz63DdEBQuwA%2C%2C]]&gt; Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction as to exactly how this is possible?  Best, James</textOnly>
