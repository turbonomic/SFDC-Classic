Hi Eric,
I hope this note finds you well! I&apos;m reaching out to see if you would be open to a conversation about how Turbonomic’s technology can help you address some of the problems specific to Education Organization and their IT professionals.
Even if you have an Ivy League-sized endowment, I have a feeling you may be under pressure to keep costs at an all-time low. This requirement might seem as if it’s in direct contrast to delivering the highest quality IT services to students, faculty and staff. What if I told you it didn’t have to be?
I&apos;d love to learn more about your current approach to these challenges, and share how we’ve helped organizations like Boston College and Georgetown overcome them. Below are the truly compelling results we have driven across all our Education customers:
I also noticed on your LinkedIn that you used to work at JP Morgan Chase, a very satisfied customer of ours. At JPMC, we delivered George Sherman (Managing Director): 
	- $3.9M immediate CapEx deferment, adding 3,000+ additional VMs without additional infrastructure	- 6,500 ESX host environment identified over provisioned by 1,950 hosts	- 40,000+ VDI workloads - 35,000 initial performance assurance actions, and ongoing performance assurance for all workloads across on-premises IaaS environment
With these undeniable results, JPMC inducted Turbonomic into their Hall of Innovation in 2013. &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/jpmorgan-chase-is-a-believer/]]&gt; I’m confident that we could provide similar benefits to the University of Houston, and I’m only asking for 30 minutes of your time to introduce you to Turbonomic at a high level. What are your thoughts on connecting later this week or early next?  Best, Alex Opiela | TurbonomicO: 857.305.5823 M: 508.838.0272    </textOnly>
