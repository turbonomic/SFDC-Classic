    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

With the NBA season upcoming and the Warriors gearing up for another successful run to the finals I thought you’d be interested in the chance to see a game.

I’m reaching out from Turbonomic, and I’d like to share with you why HP, Cisco, JP Morgan, and 1700+ more trust our platform in their on premise and cloud environments. Turbonomic can help you achieve several different IT initiatives, whether it’s reducing infrastructure and cloud spend, or preventing performance issues that impact employees and customers, we do it all while remaining compliant with your business policies.

In exchange for a face-to-face meeting, I’d be happy to send some Warriors tickets your way. Sign up here! &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/special-invitation-golden-state-warriors-tickets/]]&gt; Here’s the view from the seats:



Please let us know if you are open to further exploring the possibilities of Turbonomic’s platform.

Yours Sincerely,

Shannon Burgess</textOnly>
