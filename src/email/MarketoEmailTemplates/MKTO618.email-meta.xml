    <textOnly>Calling All Green Circle EA Members:
Tell Us About VMTurbo Operations Manager Spring &apos;14 Release
Simplicity from Complexity
Order from Chaos
More from Less
VMTurbo Operations Manager Spring &apos;14 Release has been available since May 7, and we&apos;re asking Green Circle Community Early Access members for feedback. Haven&apos;t updated? Learn how here: http://bit.ly/SeXOVx

This release features key improvements to VMTurbo&apos;s award-winning Operations Manager product line, adding new functionality to the world&apos;s most advanced virtualization control platform:

 - EMC VNX Storage Control. Operations Manager Storage Control Module now extends beyond NetApp into EMC VNX, providing unprecedented visibility and intelligent recommendations to optimize VNX LUN sizing, pool configurations, and datastore placements.
 - Cluster Flattening Mode. Leverage cluster capacity to the fullest, with affinity-abiding cross-cluster migrations.
 - UCS Port Consolidation. Fabric Control enhancements identify opportunities for UCS port consolidation to reduce UCS licensing costs.
 - Custom Dashboards. Customize panels in Dashboards view, and print reports directly to PDF.

Please offer your feedback, initial impressions, and other thoughts directly in The Green Circle Product Forum: http://bit.ly/1nAU3FQ. Also, if you would like to be contacted for EA to future releases, let us know here: mailto:pm@vmturbo.com.
