    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, I hope this note finds you well! My name is Brendan Booth and I’m reaching out because I understand your organization is focused on improving efficiency and reducing over-provisioning. I&apos;d like to see if you would be open to a conversation about how Turbonomic’s technology can address some of the challenges specific to infrastructure projects such as this for ***COMPANY***. As you’re aware, virtualized infrastructures typically end up being over-provisioned to meet QoS requirements, all too often to the detriment of efficient IT management. This is largely due to labor-intensive planning methods and an inability to manually respond to rapidly fluctuating workload demands. I’d like to spend some time sharing with you how we‘ve helped organizations like JP Morgan Chase and IDEXX Laboratories  overcome their infrastructure efficiency challenges and reduce over-provisioning with success. Would you be open to a conversation at ***INSERT DATE*** at ***INSERT TIME***or ***INSERT TIME***?   Best,  Brendan</textOnly>
