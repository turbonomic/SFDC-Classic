Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me during the IT Director&apos;s Forum and discuss how VMTurbo can help you to drive better cost efficiencies from your virtualised datacentre resources, whilst ensuring application performance.

My colleagues and I look forward to following up with you to understand more about your virtualisation roadmap over the next 12-15 months.

Regards,
Andrew Mallaband
