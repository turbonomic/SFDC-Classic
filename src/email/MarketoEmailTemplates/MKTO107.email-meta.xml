Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Happy New Year! Looking back on 2012, we certainly saw tremendous growth in virtual infrastructure — the number of virtualized hosts and applications as well as VM densities all grew across most IT infrastructures. The confluence of these factors introduced some new challenges for how we manage and control this growing estate.

At VMTurbo, we believe a new approach &lt;http://bit.ly/WrdY8Z&gt; is required to meet 
these challenges - one that controls the environment by automating decision-making instead of just providing alerts. Companies of all sizes - those with only a handful of hosts to large enterprises like BT and Colgate Palmolive - and cloud service providers, including CSC and Layered Tech, are using our solution as control system for their virtualized infrastructure. And they are seeing remarkable efficiency gains by reducing time spent troubleshooting and maximizing infrastructure utilization.

So, as you contemplate your initiatives in 2013, improving and simplifying IT control should be one of them. There are huge gains to be made and proven technologies that can help you do so. I invite you to read through this paper &lt;http://bit.ly/WrdY8Z&gt; to get a deeper understanding of the things you should be looking at as you embark on this initiative.

Best regards,

Shmuel Kliger
