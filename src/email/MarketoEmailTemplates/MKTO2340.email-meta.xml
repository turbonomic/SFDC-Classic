    <subject>{{lead.First Name}}, $25 Amazon for 5 Minute Cloud Readiness Survey?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},


Turbonomic is in the midst of a remarkable transformation, as more and more of our customers are adopting public cloud at a significantly faster pace than pundits predicted.



I invite and ask that you please take our 5-Minute Cloud Readiness Survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cloud-readiness-commercial-direct]]&gt; in exchange for a $25 Amazon.com gift card, no strings attached. We are simply trying to get a pulse on the market.


If you so choose, you may opt-in at the end of the survey for an additional $100 Amazon.com gift card to consult with a Turbonomic engineer and learn about our cloud offerings and how we can help you bridge from on-premises private data center management to the cloud. Thank you in advance for your time.




 &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cloud-readiness-commercial-direct]]&gt;
Yours sincerely,
Chris Graham</textOnly>
