    <subject>46% Of VDI Projects Stall, Donâ€™t Let Yours Be One Of Them</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
 &lt;http://vmturbo.com/wp-vdi-performance?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wcast_stencil_love&amp;utm_content=wp_offer&gt;
Did you know that 46% of VDI projects stall? Its a daunting number that we want to decrease, and this paper is designed to do just that.
Download this paper &lt;http://vmturbo.com/wp-vdi-performance?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wcast_stencil_love&amp;utm_content=wp_offer&gt; and join the discussion on how to prevent VDI performance degradation and budget over runs in a VDI deployment. The two main VDI project killers.
In this paper you will learn how to:


 - Manage extreme storage I/O demand, the biggest challenge facing performance assurance in a VDI environment
 - Quickly place new desktop workloads factoring in real-time resource allocation and continuous changes in the underlying infrastructure
 - Assure end-users receive a desktop like experience by minimizing latency and leveraging your existing hardware
 - Prevent I/O intensive tasks (e.g. patch updates, antivirus updates, reboots) from overtaxing your storage footprint
 - Assure VDI performance of your environment while maximizing utilization
