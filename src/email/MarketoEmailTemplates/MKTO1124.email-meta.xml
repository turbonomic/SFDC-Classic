Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
We haven&apos;t heard from you in a while, and we&apos;re starting to think that something terrible may have happened. Please let us know that you haven&apos;t...turned.

Zombie VMs are taking over and it was only a matter of time until those in the datacenter became infected. Fear not though, for there is a cure. VMTurbo is here to stop these Zombie VMs in there tracks; increasing efficiency, reducing latency and overall saving the world.

Find out how in the report below.
