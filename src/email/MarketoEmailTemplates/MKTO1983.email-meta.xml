Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Network-heavy, scale-out workloads place considerable stress on today’s rapidly growing virtualized and cloud datacenters. Emerging software-defined networking (SDN) technologies aim to mitigate the potential bottlenecks that can precipitate at the network layer in such environments, as well as simplify network design.
Despite advances in both hardware and software, there remain significant challenges, as well as optimization opportunities, at the network layer. Specifically, incorporating topological and traffic-matrix awareness to VM placement decisions holds tremendous promise for increasing application performance.
This whitepaper explores the benefits of incorporating network topology and traffic-matrix information in VM placement decisions, as well as challenges preventing organizations from doing so today.
