    <subject>Want Self-Managing Kubernetes? Would you invest 60 minutes?</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-demo-kubernetes]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
 
 
 
 
 Great meeting you at KubeCon and hope you enjoyed the T-shirt! 
 
 
 
 
 We had a brief amount of time to discuss what self-managing Kubernetes means, so we’re wondering if you’d like to see how Turbonomic’s full-stack optimization works in your own environment. Below is an overview of what you can expect from a 1-hour call, and we are always happy to tailor it to fit your specific needs. 
 
 
 
 
    Schedule My Personalized Demo &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-demo-kubernetes]]&gt;    
 
 
 
 
 Cheers,
