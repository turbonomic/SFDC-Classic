    <subject>You&apos;re Invited On Us: A Bruins Game for Octurbofest 2014</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir or Madam}}:

It is my pleasure to cordially invite you to VMTurbo’s First Annual Octurbofest &lt;http://vmturbo.com/octurbofest2014/?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=octurbofest&amp;utm_content=091114&gt;. You were recently sent a physical mailer of this same invite, so pardon my redundancy. I simply wish to guarantee you&apos;re included in our invitation.

This daylong event will be held Wednesday, October 8, 2014 at the Omni Parker House Hotel in Boston – followed by an evening in an executive suite at the Boston Bruins home opener versus the Philadelphia Flyers.

For your convenience, we have scheduled Octurbofest the day before the Boston VMUG User Conference (October 9). Offered at no cost to you or your colleagues, this exclusive event features a program of cloud and virtualization thought leadership discussions, two VMTurbo customer keynotes, and an inside look at the 2015 VMTurbo Roadmap – including ventures into holistic control for Application Performance Management and Software-Defined Networking – from founders Shmuel Kliger and Yuri Rabover.

You can register here &lt;http://vmturbo.com/octurbofest2014/?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=octurbofest&amp;utm_content=091114&gt;, and a VMTurbo executive will also contact you to address any questions you may have. I hope you will attend this exciting event; that we may cheer on the B’s together.

Sincerely,
J. Benjamin H. Nye
Chief Executive Officer
