Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


As you know, it is easy for vendors to come off as aggressive and transactional. At Turbonomic our mission is to be far more than that. This is why we want to take a step back, let you know that we understand your limited time is extremely valuable and extend an offer to partner with you to help make the world a better place.
 
We are excited to announce the launch of our Cloud Migration Survey &lt;[[http://bit.ly/2LWT4nr]]&gt;. We are offering a $10 Amazon gift card for completing the 3-minute survey by August 6th. Furthermore, we are offering $100 Amazon gift card for agreeing to a 30-minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer (meeting must complete by August 17th). If at the end of the meeting, you choose to engage in a proof of value, we will make a $300 donation to the 501(c)(3) charity of your choosing.


 &lt;[[http://bit.ly/2LWT4nr]]&gt;




We look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about why more than 100 of the Fortune 500 trust Turbonomic for their hybrid cloud, but we are much more excited to partner with you to make an impact for a cause that is close to you.



Regards, 
Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
