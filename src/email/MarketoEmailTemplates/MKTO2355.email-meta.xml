{{lead.First Name:default=Hello}},
As you know, it is easy for vendors to come off as aggressive and transactional. At Turbonomic our mission is to be far more than that. This is why we want to take a step back, let you know that we think your time is extremely valuable and take a moment to better understand the daily challenges you face.

We are excited to announce the launch of our Infrastructure Optimisation Survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VH39V3P?marketo_rh4jcbhz9s=[marketo_rh4jcbhz9s_value]]]&gt;. We are offering a £25 Amazon gift card for completing the 5 minute survey by April 28th.
We look forward to the opportunity to speak with you around how Turbonomic is changing the IT industry for the better.
