    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I appreciate learning about the challenges you face and goals you have for managing the virtual infrastructure at your institution.

As we discussed, receiving a no-obligation demonstration of VMTurbo Operations Manager is a valuable way for you to figure out how Operations Manager can address resource contention before problems occur, make certain that applications have the resources they require, and ensure the infrastructure is utilized in the most efficient way possible in your environment.

I’ve scheduled the demo and you should have received a meeting request from me already (if not, you should soon). We’re excited to show you how our solution can impact IT operations at your site—just like we’ve helped our 8,000 other users to date. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
