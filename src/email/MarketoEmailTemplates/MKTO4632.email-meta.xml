    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Did you know that AWS offers discounted pricing for their enterprise customers? 


Check out our on-demand webinar to see how you can best take advantage of these discounts with Turbonomic which allows you to see your actual charges as well as projected savings per service item for real-time and planning scenarios within our platform.

In this webinar, you will learn:



	- How to modify the pricing in Turbonomic to reflect the discount off my negotiated EPD or EA contracts

	- How to run a migration plan that incorporates these discounts

	- How to really turn ON the optimization with your discounts




We hope you find it helpful!
