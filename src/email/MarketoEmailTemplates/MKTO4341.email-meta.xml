    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I’m planning to be in Atlanta on December 6th, and will be hosting a group of local IT leaders for an afternoon at the Atlanta Porsche Experience Center. I would love if you could join me.

Not only will you be able to drive some of the best cars in the world, but you’ll have the chance to network with your peers on topics such as:


	- Implementing an effective hybrid cloud strategy
	- Accelerating your public cloud migration projects
	- Continuously optimizing your IT infrastructure
	- And much more



Will you join me? Spots are filling up fast, click here to reserve your car &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/vip-atlanta-2/]]&gt;.

Best,
 Steve
