Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

The storage world is all about a software-defined approach, but the real win comes when you bring storage performance, compliance, and efficiency automation together across your hybrid environment with Turbonomic.


Please join us for a live demo tomorrow illustrating everything from storage migrations and movement, to in-guest storage features, cloud storage automation, and even on-prem infrastructure capabilities.Â 


 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/storage-performance-automation-webinar/]]&gt;

In this 30-minute live demo, Director of Technical Marketing and Technology Evangelist, Eric Wright will take you from zero to hero with your storage team and everyone across the IT organization.


We hope to see you there!


Regards,
Elizabeth</textOnly>
