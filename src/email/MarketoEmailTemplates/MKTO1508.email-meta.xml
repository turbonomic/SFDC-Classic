Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
Tune in toady at 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM EST as VMTurbo hosts Virtualization Field Day 5, live from our brand new offices in downtown Boston.
If you aren&apos;t familiar with the Tech Field Day Series, these events bring together vendors and members from the community to have technical discussions about various vendors&apos; products and offerings and are streamed live on their website &lt;http://techfieldday.com/event/vfd5/&gt;.
The full listing of the vendors presenting, including the schedule can be found here &lt;http://techfieldday.com/event/vfd5/&gt;. 
We hope to see you on the live stream and make sure to engage with the #VFD5 hashtag on Twitter for more exciting news!
