Between 2001 and 2015, the percentage of hospitals adopting EMR/EHR systems has skyrocketed from 18.2% to 84% and PACS storage requirements are growing at more than 20% per year. This massive increase in data is forcing healthcare IT professionals to adapt quickly, all while keeping compliance regulations and budgetary constraints in mind. Not to be forgotten is the fast approaching ICD-10 compliance deadline.

Join VMTurbo and Mary Washington Healthcare as we discuss challenges faced by healthcare organizations attempting to adhere to regulations while maintaining efficient and effective IT operations.

During the webinar, you will learn about:


 - Eliminating contention-based VM outages and failures
 - Using what-if capacity planning to maximize utilization and grow with precision
 - Automating VM migration using VMTurboâ€™s Economic Scheduling Engine
 - How MWHC saw more than $180,000 in savings in just one day through intelligent workload management



- The VMTurbo Team
