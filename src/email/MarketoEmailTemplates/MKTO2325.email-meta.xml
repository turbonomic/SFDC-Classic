In short, I was hoping that during the month of June you would be open to my team and I providing an introduction as to how Turbonomic’s intelligent automation allows for our customers to save hundreds of thousands on capital and operational expenses usually allocated towards the infrastructure.  Our customers see the following benefits after installing Turbonomic:  ·         Reduce the amount of time spent caring for/maintaining your virtual infrastructure by leveraging software to analyze resource demand in real-time across capacity, placement, and configuration.·         Act as a single pane of glass across your environment; across any technology ·         Providing executable actions around placement and sizing that can be leveraged in a manual or automated fashion to prevent resource-contention &amp; application delay·         Increase IT agility/compatibility to meet the business requirements·         Reduce future costs on servers, storage, and licensing, while maximizing the effectiveness of your current environment Below are some materials that provide some insight into the value our customers see in Turbonomic.  Turbonomic ROI &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_ROI.pdf]]&gt; Principle Technologies: Turbonomic Improves Application Performance  &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgdVn3dW8qSQCx76hVPRN72kTf31sBwYf7xKJSz03?t=https%3A%2F%2Fturbonomic.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fprincipled-technologies-vmturbo-improve-application-performance%2F&amp;si=6013571735748608&amp;pi=0746823d-c1d0-407a-9e5a-0c84204c0246]]&gt;  I was hoping that we could put some tentative time in the calendar for June to provide the introduction through WebEx to you and the team. Is there a date where I send along a tentative invite?  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
