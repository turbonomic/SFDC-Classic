    <subject>Turbonomic EA, Thank You!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

I wanted to personally, and on behalf of our Product Management team, thank you for participating in our 6.1 Early Access program. We could not have gotten this release shipped in time and with such high quality without your willingness to deploy and provide us with invaluable feedback.

Please take a moment to give us feedback on our Early Access program and claim your rewards for participating. Youâ€™ve earned them!

You can also learn about everything that 6.1 has in store here &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/introducing-turbonomic-6-1]]&gt;.

Thanks again for being a part of our journey!
