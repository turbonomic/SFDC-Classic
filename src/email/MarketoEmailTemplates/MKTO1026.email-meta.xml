    <subject>3-minute Open Cloud Survey Closes Tonight! – Win A Home Lab</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

Don&apos;t miss your chance to be a part of the OpenStack Discussion!

OpenStack deployments among big names like Walmart, Best Buy, Comcast, and PayPal suggest a shift in the industry - open cloud is here to stay. But what are you seeing? You know how you and your organization are approaching (or not approaching) open cloud. Are you also wondering how other organizations like you are tackling it? We are.

Please take this ~3 minute survey to share your experience. This survey closes tonight at 11:00pm EST!
