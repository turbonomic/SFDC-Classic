    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for visiting our booth at CiscoLive!  Did you have a chance to speak with our team? Turbonomic offers a great solution leveraged in the data centers of JPMC, PNC, TD Ameritrade, Cisco, HP, BMC and more.

Application performance is vital to your business success.  Assuring application performance requires that the right amount of infrastructure is delivered to the right workload, at the right time.

How do you currently allocate resources to assure performance?  Do you guess?  Overprovision for business peaks?  Many organizations use both of these methods then rely on alerts and thresholds to monitor performance.  The cloud and internet of things have made these methods obsolete. 
Here’s how:
