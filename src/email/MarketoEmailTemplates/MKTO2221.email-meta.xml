    <subject>Cut Back On 24/7 IT (1494331542.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Renee,

I was compelled to reach out given my research and the success that customers like Mary Washington Healthcare &lt;[[https://cdn.turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-MaryWashingtonHealthcare-Success-Story.pdf]]&gt;, St. Anthony&apos;s Medical Center &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-StAnthonysMedicalCenter-Success-Story.pdf]]&gt;, Dartmouth Hitchcock etc. have seen in our technology. Additionally I read an article in the Milford Daily News &lt;[[http://www.milforddailynews.com/news/20160808/businessperson-profile-on-naticks-renee-fosberg]]&gt; and was intrigued by the emphasis you put on 24/7 IT and the idea that downtime is not an option when it comes to taking care of the sick. 24/7 autonomic IT is a huge part of Turbonomic’s value proposition.
 Turbonomic is a self-managing control solution that continuously assures the performance of your applications across virtual and cloud infrastructures by aligning your workload demands with infrastructure supply in real time. As far as 24/7 management, Turbo is offloading the current mode of operations (trouble shooting and responding to alerts) to software to achieve application performance while being as efficient as possible &amp; with minimal reliance on people allowing your team to focus on projects, innovation, and cut down on the 24/7 manual labor.
 Results: 
 	- 37% increase in application performance  	- 40% increase in VM/host density  
	- 80% decrease in troubleshooting and ticketing



 Do you have time in the coming weeks for an introductory call?

 Best,
