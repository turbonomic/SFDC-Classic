She is lovely (and not just because she is Irish!)She mentioned to reach out in a month so I will absolutely do that. Is there a time or day that works best for you so I don’t call out of the blue? Looking forward to connecting and glad to have a chance to chat again! Katie                     Katie NorchiSales Development RepresentativeO: 857.305.4618  C: 440.708.8477500 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02116 </textOnly>
