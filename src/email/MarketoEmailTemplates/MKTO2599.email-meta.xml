Back in 2014 you and the team at iTopia were customers of Turbonomic (then VMTurbo) and I wanted to see if you might have some time in May or June to review the platform again to see what is new with Turbonomic.  With a new update every quarter, there have been quite a few changes on our side including the rebrand to Turbonomic but our general mission is still the same: Turbnonomic’s control platform increases application performance on less infrastructure.  Do you have time over the next couple of months to do a 30 minutes review of what is new?  Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
