Are you seeing any more information now that the platform has been in your environment for a few weeks? Let me know any feedback, concerns or questions you might have. Would it make sense for us to jump on another call to answer any questions or concerns you have? Let me know what you think would be best.  Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
