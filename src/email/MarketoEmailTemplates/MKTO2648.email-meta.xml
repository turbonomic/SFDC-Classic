Do you have 30 minutes over the couple of weeks for an introduction call?   Best regards, James From: James Wilcox

Subject: RE: PCSB Tech and Information Systems virtualized environment Hi Thomas,  Below is a video of the CIO of BMC, Scott Crowder and his team explaining the value that he sees in Turbonomic after implementing the platform into their internal infrastructure.  With Turbonomic, they were able to increase the capacity of their infrastructure by 25% while “performance went through the roof”.  Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; I was hoping to get the chance introduce the platform to you and the team to see if we could provide the same value to the PCSB team. We are also offering a $15,000 discount to any state or local institution for the month of May for anyone that chooses to evaluate during the month of May because we know that usually governmental entities run a June/July fiscal year end.  Do you have 30 minutes in the month of May for my team and I to introduce the platform to you and the team at Pinellas County Public Schools?  Best regards, James From: James Wilcox
