Activate Virtual Health Monitor Today.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

A few days back, you downloaded the VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor (VHM), but it probably feels like forever ago, because you haven’t yet activated your appliance.

Activate now, and within minutes you’ll gain mountaintop visibility into your virtual environment, wielding the power to identify problems in real time. Performance reports? All yours. In perpetuity. Forever.

Once you&apos;ve deployed VHM, the initial credentials are administrator for username and password. The setup wizard will handle the rest.

Ready for the big leagues? Download a full-featured 30-day trial of &lt;http://bit.ly/1k61Zyy&gt; VMTurbo Operations Manager, the world’s most advanced virtualization management platform.



In good health,
VMTurbo
