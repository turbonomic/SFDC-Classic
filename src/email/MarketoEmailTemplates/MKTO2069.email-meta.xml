Partner Promotion: Hardware Refresh
With today&apos;s hardware refresh cycle averaging between three and five years, IT organizations are constantly thinking about their next system updates/upgrades. By introducing Turbonomic to your customers who are in the midst of a hardware refresh cycle, you are enabling these organizations to assure performance and maximize efficiency. 

We are excited to announce that our Hardware Refresh Platinum Partner Promotion will run from February 21, 2017 - April 31, 2017. During this time, Platinum Partners that introduce Turbonomic to a prospect who is undergoing, or planning to undergo, a hardware refresh project, will be eligible for an additional 15% discount on their Turbonomic transfer price. Simply register your opportunity in the Turbonomic Deal Registration Portal with the code &quot;TurboHardware&quot;! 

On our Partner Promotion Page &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-4416]]&gt;, you will find hardware refresh collateral that you can leverage to enable you and your teams - from blog posts, to webinars, to case studies - we encourage you to share this collateral on your platforms with your customers. 
Upcoming Training: ACE Certification

Turbonomic&apos;s ACE Training program signifies the mastery of Turbonomic technology and its autonomic control system actions, including knowledge of all dashboards, administration, plan function and reservations, and deployment. To be certified, individuals must complete a two-day course and pass multiple-choice and practical exams. Those who are ACE Certified join a growing community of thought leaders in virtualization and cloud management.

We also believe in the value having partners ACE certified brings to not only our customers and partners, but to us here at Turbonomic as well. Orna Kliger, Senior Director of the Turbonomic Circle of Excellence noted, &quot;We are excited about the increasing number of partners who have earned Turbonomic ACE Certification. They learn how to maximize the value of their investment in our platform, and we gain so much from their perspective.&quot;
