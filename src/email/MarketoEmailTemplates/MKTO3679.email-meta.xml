Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

At Turbonomic, we believe partner success and profitability are the two most important elements of a successful partnership!

We are seeing cloud computing spend growing at 6x the rate of IT, reaching a market size of $162B by 2020 according to IDC. This incredible opportunity is the catalyst behind our new partner program that will deliver even greater customer value and partner profitability.

Partners can now leverage our NEW training and accreditation platform to accelerate time-to-delivery of valuable customer support and services while increasing revenue streams. In addition, our NEW generous discounts and incentives will ensure partners remain relevant in this fiercely competitive market.

Join us on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 1:00 pm ET to learn how you can leverage our NEW program to boost your bottom line. During this session, you’ll hear about:


	- 
NEW! Partner Program Paths 

	- NEW! Competitive Discounts &amp; Incentives

	- NEW! Tools &amp; Resources

	- NEW! Sales, Technical &amp; Post-Sales Partner Accreditations

	- NEW! Market Development Funds (MDF) Program 

	- NEW! Marketing Campaigns



We believe this NEW program – along with our AI-driven workload automation technology that recommends where to place workloads, ensuring they get the exact resources needed, at the right time – will well position you in this Cloud market.
