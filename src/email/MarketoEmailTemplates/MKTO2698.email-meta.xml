    <subject>{{lead.First Name:default=}}, hoping to connect at the June 6 CIO Summit</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},


I&apos;ll be at the Chicago HMG Strategy CIO Summit on June 6, and was hoping we could connect for a minute or two so I can share a bit about Turbonomic and how we&apos;ve helped enterprises like JPMC, Apple, Travelport, Barclays and Cisco transform their service delivery.

Additionally Turbonomic will have a box at the June 8 Cubs game against the Rockies, where customer executives from Morningstar will join us to share their experience of Turbonomic. Can we plan to connect on the 6th? I promise I&apos;ll be very respectful of your time.

Many thanks,
Josh Cramer

Enterprise Account Executive, Turbonomic
