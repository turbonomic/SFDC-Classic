    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
It was great to catch up with you at Microsoft Inspire this year! It is an exciting time for the partnership between Turbonomic and Microsoft.


As a leading ISV for Azure Assessment, Planning and Optimization engagements, we’d love to share more of our insight with you. Check out our Turbonomic and Microsoft resource center here &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/microsoft-and-turbonomic]]&gt;. It includes a recent video on how we are delivering on our promise of 7 Days to Azure &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/videos/7-days-to-azure]]&gt;. 
 

If you&apos;re ready, we&apos;d also love to have a one-on-one conversation with you to learn more about your team and your priorities. With your input, we can take you through a customized demo of our platform and show you exactly where we can help. Please schedule a meeting &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-demo/]]&gt; with us today.


Thank you, 

Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
