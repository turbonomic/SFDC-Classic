    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


I hope this note finds you well. With Cisco Live coming up June 10 -13, 2019, I am reaching out to see if you plan on attending this year. If so, I&apos;d like to invite you to meet with our executive team.
 
At Cisco Live, we look forward to the opportunity to connect with you to discuss your digital transformation strategy and challenges your IT organization might be facing.

I hope to see you there!
