<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I wanted to let you know that we are running a special promotion for meeting with us over the next month. If you complete an introductory meeting with Turbonomic before June 23rd, we will enter you in a raffle to win a trip for two (2) to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game in Miami, Florida from July 9 - 12, 2017. </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Turbonomic’s autonomic workload management platform frees up operations, infrastructure, architecture and engineering teams from manual management and planning within any cloud or on-prem environment, enabling you to work more effectively together as you pursue strategic initiatives. We’d like to show you how - and give you an opportunity to watch the best baseball players in the league come together for an unforgettable event. </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">If you’d like to be entered, you can <a href="https://turbonomic.com/mlb-all-star-experience-giveaway/" target="_blank" id="">visit this page</a>, or just let me know and I will work with you directly to schedule our meeting and put you into the raffle. </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Best,</span></p>
