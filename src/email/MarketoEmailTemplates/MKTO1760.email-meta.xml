    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Partner}}, 
Join us for a hands-on technology workshop with Razor &amp; VMTurbo and learn how to manage application demand from industry experts! You&apos;ll witness firsthand how VMTurbo operates in your data center, manages workloads and preventatively reallocates resources while increasing your overall efficiency.
In this instructor led workshop, you will be guided through several lab modules: modeling hypothetical scenarios, creating custom dashboards, demonstrating use cases requiring deeper integrations, and much more. Additionally, we&apos;re holding an in-depth Q&amp;A session where we&apos;ll answer all of your burning questions.
Please bring your laptop and have the VMTurbo software installed on your device before attending the workshop.
