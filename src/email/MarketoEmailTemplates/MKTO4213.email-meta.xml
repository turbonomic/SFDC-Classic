    <textOnly>All Treats and No Tricks This October
We can feel the air getting crisper and the leaves certainly seem like they are on the verge of changing colors any day now, and we all know what that means… and no I am not talking about Halloween just yet. With the beginning of fall comes one of our favorite days of the year: Customer Experience Day! Here at Turbonomic, we take this day to not just appreciate our Customer Experience Team but also all of you, our dedicated customers, who have joined us on our journey to workload automation. 

Just because October 2nd was the official International CX Day, doesn’t mean the celebration of our team or our customers stops there. Part of our appreciation shines through our product and the additions our engineers have been able to produce in our newest release of Turbonomic 6.2 &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/turbonomic-6-2]]&gt;. With the release of Turbonomic 6.2 our CTO, Charles Crouchman wrote a blog announcing our newest expansions in Turbonomic’s hybrid and public cloud capabilities &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/turbonomic-6-2/]]&gt; and how it further supports workload automation for hybrid cloud environments. CRN also covered the new release in this article &lt;[[https://custom.crn.com/news/cloud/turbonomic-doubles-down-on-microsoft-azure-migrations-with-latest-software-release]]&gt;, which explores the negative implications of lifting and shifting without accurate assessments of on-premises resources. 

Looking forward, 
we have an exciting webinar calendar for the month of October with Live Demos that highlight the new features in Turbonomic 6.2 &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/turbonomic-6-2]]&gt;.
