    <textOnly>Hi Chris, 
   Thank you for your time and insight today. We look forward to hearing from you and hope that we were able to highlight key benefits of our Control Platform to drive Performance and Efficiency.

   Enterprises are starting to realize that managing environments reactively with monitoring, alerting, reporting solutions and humans does not scale, is not cost efficient and ultimately does not assure performance.

   Turbonomic’s goal is to help assure performance without the need to chase alerts and be reactive. 
   
   
 	- Quick Time to Value – from Install (15-min) to Value (60-min) 
 	- Deployed at Credit Suisse globally during one 60-min maintenance window 
	- Further enabled automation over the next 60-min maintenance window

 
 	- Understand Application Demand and automatically match that Demand with the Supply (infrastructure) 
 
	- Real-time size up and down recommendations

 
 	- Identify Risks present – and provide actions (not alerts) to drive environment to a better state – via one click Automation 
 
	- Actions with the ultimate goal of avoiding problems to begin with

 
 
	- No thresholds needed to be setup

 	- On average 20% - 40% increase in density (avoiding the need to buy unnecessary hardware) 
 	- Barclays has avoided buying servers for 2-years+ 
	- Ability to eliminate and avoid licensing (Windows, Linux, SQL, Oracle, etc)
