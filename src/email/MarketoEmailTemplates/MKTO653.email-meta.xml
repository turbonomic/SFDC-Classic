Storage Isn&apos;t Cheap. Reclaim It.
Storage resource contention is one of the greatest performance threats to virtual infrastructures, and one of the most frustrating pains suffered by IT administrators. Why can’t virtualization and storage play nicely? Even in the most efficient environments, bottlenecks at the storage layer can adversely affect application performance just as much as contention at the server layer. While overprovisioning arrays, I/O, and disk capacity is one method to avoid resource contention, this approach is capitally wasteful, avoidably increasing cost per GB per VM.

Read this whitepaper for these 3 takeaways:
 - How to intelligently map VMs to underlying arrays for efficient storage provisioning
 - Thin provisioning best practices
 - Deduplication and compression best practices
