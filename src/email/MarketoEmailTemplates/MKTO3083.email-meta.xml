Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Next week, on Thursday, September 28th, the New York City Turbonomic and Presidio Community is looking forward to an evening at The Golf Club at Chelsea Pier for a happy hour and of course, golf. Together, we will brush up on our skills with a help of a golf pro and casually learn about our product roadmap from current Turbonomic and Presidio customers.
Will you join me and your technology peers on September 28th?
