    <subject>How can we help you get the most out of VMT?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=VMT Champion}},
We hope you are enjoying your experience with VMTurbo. We just wanted to check in quickly and were hoping to set aside a few minutes to see how things are going so far!
Keeping up to date with a company that is moving as quickly as us can be difficult â€“ that is why we now have ongoing free monthly training (sign up here &lt;http://vmturbo.com/vmturbo-new-customer-jumpstart/&gt;) and built the Green Circle Community &lt;https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/welcome&gt;. 
As your Customer Experience team, our goal is to help you and your organization get the most out of VMTurbo. We can help align technical sessions, training, as well as set you and the team up for the Green Circle. We will also always be available for ad-hoc sessions based off your needs, questions, or projects you have where you would like to leverage VMTurbo. 
We want to make sure your journey with VMTurbo is as successful as possible, so please feel free to reach out with any problem, concern or feedback you may have!
Can we catch up this week for 10 to 15 minutes to determine how we can best support you? 
Best,
Your Dedicated Customer Experience Team</textOnly>
