Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},





I&apos;ve been speaking with IT thought-leaders like you about the ways they are migrating their on-premises to AWS &amp; Azure while consolidating their on-premises footprint. What has become clear is this problem is beyond human scale.


Turbonomic&apos;s Workload Automation solution for Hybrid Cloud enables out 2000+ customers to reduce the cost, risk, and complexity associated with migration and consolidation. 


Our agnostic platform (supports VMware, AWS, Azure, etc.) provides ongoing optimization both on-premise and once workloads are in the cloud to ensure you&apos;re only paying for what you consume.


For a bit more context, please see the resources below:
