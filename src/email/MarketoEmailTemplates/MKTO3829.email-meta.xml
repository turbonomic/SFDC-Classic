    <textOnly>Internal Only - Cisco Workload Optimization Day – You’re Invited!

Cisco and Turbonomic &lt;[[http://www.turbonomic.com/]]&gt; have recently partnered to deliver Cisco Workload Optimization Manager &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZPzX94eGI]]&gt; (WOM).  

Cisco® Workload Optimization Manager enables data center and cloud infrastructure to self-manage. With the platform, infrastructure dynamically adjusts to meet changing workload demand—ensuring continuous health in the environment. It relieves Infrastructure and Operations teams from the day-to-day management of infrastructure and resource availability, giving them time back to drive innovation for the business.
