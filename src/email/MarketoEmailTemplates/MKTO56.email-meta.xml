    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.  I appreciate learning about the challenges you face and goals you have for managing the virtual infrastructure at your institution.

As we discussed, VMTurbo’s free 30-day trial is a valuable way for you to figure out how Operations Manager can address resource contention before  problems occur, make certain that applications have the resources they require, and ensure the infrastructure is utilized in the most efficient way possible—with no financial obligation. Start a trial now.  We’d love to help you like we’ve helped our 8,000 other users to date.

Once you get going, I will check back in to make sure you are getting the most out of your evaluation.
