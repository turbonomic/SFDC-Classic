    <subject>VMworld 2013 Barcelona: Thanks for Visiting</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for stopping by our booth at VMworld in Barcelona last week.

VMTurbo Operations Manager goes beyond monitoring and reporting on the state of your virtual environment. It displays recommended actions you can take to maintain optimal operating conditions, and can be configured to automatically perform the actions it prescribes—preventing contention and problems from occurring.

And in greater detail, we’d like to offer you this complimentary whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/19POOXL&gt; that will explain how you can correct and prevent the performance issues that are currently causing 46% of VDI projects to be stalled. 

But the best way to see how fast VMTurbo delivers value is to give us a try in your environment. Download this free trial &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; of our product to get started.

Sincerely,
 VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
