    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 
Per your role at ***COMPANY***, I wanted to reach out and see if I could interest you in learning about a solution that can help your team team augment your E-commerce platform. Turbonomic is currently working with customers including Rue La La, Expedia and Wayfair to improve end user experience while also saving their teams time and energy, and I’m confident we can do the same at ***Company***. 
The base of our conversation would include how Turbonomic can enable your team to: 
 	- Easily define and adhere to QoS metrics, even in the face of unpredictable demand 	- Leverage your existing infrastructure as efficiently as possible 	- One study found that a 1-second delay in webpage response time can impact overall sales conversions by 7% 
 
I’ve included a whitepaper that might be of particular interest to you and your team: Empowering E-Commerce against Unpredictable Demand &lt;[[http://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_Empowering-Ecommerce-Against-Unpredictable-Demand.pdf]]&gt; 
If you would be open to the conversation, I would welcome the opportunity to connect with you or another team member to discuss the information above and introduce you to Turbonomic. Are you available for an hour ***DAY, TIME***?  Best,   ***INSERT NAME***
