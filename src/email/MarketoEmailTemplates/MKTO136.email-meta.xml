Today, we released VMTurbo Operations Manager 3.3, our solution to help you transform your IT operations with software-defined control &lt;http://bit.ly/WZsurD&gt;. Our new version &lt;http://bit.ly/WZsHej&gt; provides simplified, unified control across heterogeneous cloud platforms that ensures workload performance and infrastructure utilization are 
maintained in the desired state. It has several new enhancements that founders Shmuel Kliger and Yuri Rabover will review in our webinar &lt;http://bit.ly/YaHSRl&gt; on Thursday, February 14.
