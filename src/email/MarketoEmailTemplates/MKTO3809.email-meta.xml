    <subject>Upgrade to Turbonomic 6.1 for Application-Aware Workload Automation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
I hope this note finds you well! I’m following up on the email I sent to you last week, offering a free assessment of your environment through the lens of Turbonomic 6.1. 
We’ve received amazing feedback on the release from customers who have taken advantage of this upgrade, and I want to make sure you don’t miss out on the ability to leverage our improved product functionality. As a reminder, some of the updates you can benefit from include:  

 	- Maximized Reserved Instance Utilization in AWS 	- Application-Aware Infrastructure Management through Integration with AppDynamics 	- Self-Managing Container Platforms, across Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift and Pivotal Cloud Foundry 	- Executive Dashboards Showing Performance Improvements and Savings 

 
If you’re interested in exploring 6.1 with a Turbonomic engineer, please reply to my email so we can schedule   time   to connect. 

 
Best,
 
 Steve
