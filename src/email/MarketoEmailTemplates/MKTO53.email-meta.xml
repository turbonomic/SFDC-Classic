Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Long time, no see! 

Since we connected at last year&apos;s Atlanta VMUG we wanted to let you know we&apos;ll be back in town next week at the Wednesday, November 7 conference at the Georgia World Conference Center. We&apos;d love to catch up with you regarding your progress in virtualizing your data center—and share how we&apos;ve improved VMTurbo Operations Manager.  

VMTurbo Operations Manager analyzes the real-time performance characteristics, resource capacity, system 
constraints and service level priorities across the virtual data center to determine, implement, and continuously adjust resource allocations and workload placement.  By doing so, VMTurbo helps you meet service levels and business goals, preventing performance bottlenecks while maximizing 
resource efficiency.  We&apos;ll make you—and your environment—more productive. Here&apos;s a preview of how we do what we do. &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/resources/videos-main/esevideo/&gt;

You have until Sunday, November 4 to register &lt;http://www.vmug.com/e/in/eid=372#reg&gt;.  Then, we hope you will stop by our booth or join our educational 
session &quot;Can You Manage Your Virtual Infrastructure So That Optimized Performance and High Resource Utilization are Not Mutually Exclusive?&quot; in breakout block #4 (3:00-3:45pm) in room C201. 

We hope to see you there!

Sincerely,
The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
