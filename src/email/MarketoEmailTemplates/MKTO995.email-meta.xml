    <subject>5 Common Server Virtualization Mistakes</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{Lead.First Name}},

You virtualized to cut costs. Problem solved, right? Wrong. 

Even though you’ve virtualized, there are still trade-offs—choices to be made, between CPU and memory, IOps and latency, compute/storage and network latency, etc. Virtualization allowed more applications to run on less infrastructure. More VMs, more workload demand, endless possibilities—and endless possible decisions to make about what to place where, when, and in what order. 

Is it any wonder then that people make mistakes along the way? Nope.
