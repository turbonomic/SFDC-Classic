    <subject>The State of Multi-Cloud 2016 - Part I</subject>

Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
Analysts and experts predict that the end state of the current IT evolution is an architecture called hybrid cloud. With the ability to port workloads between multiple virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud availability zones the hybrid cloud promises cost, performance, and availability benefits. Despite this projection, few if any organizations have achieved this end state.
Verizon and VMTurbo have collaborated on a survey series, which will collectively establish a baseline for where organizations currently reside along the journey, and establish a framework for proceeding on the path to hybrid cloud over the next three years.
Download this first in the series of four reports to learn how your organization stacks up:




 - How long will it take you?
 - How much will it cost you?
 - What challenges lie ahead when you adopt Multi-Cloud?
