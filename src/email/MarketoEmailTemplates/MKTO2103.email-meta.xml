    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},   
   We recently launched our Infrastructure Optimization Survey &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/m000Zg10g0cg9gZyIe00ZH0]]&gt;, and are offering a $25 Amazon gift card for completing the 5 minute survey by April 1st. We are also offering $100 Amazon gift card for agreeing to a 30 minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer (meeting must complete by April 15th). If at the end of the meeting, you choose to engage in a proof of value, we will donate $1,000 to the 501(c)(3) charity of your choosing.   
   I’m sure you get hundreds of emails each week from vendors, which is why we wanted to take a moment to let you know we understand your time is extremely valuable and extend an offer to partner with you to support a cause that is close to you.    
   I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about the benefits Turbonomic can bring to your infrastructure!  
   
   Best,</textOnly>
