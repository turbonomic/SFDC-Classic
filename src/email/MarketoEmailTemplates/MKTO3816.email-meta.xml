Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
What do Google, eBay and Starbucks have in common? Yes, they are all well-known household names, but those names haven’t always been what they are today. Before they were multi-billion dollar companies, they were Backrub, AuctionWeb and Il Giornale Coffee Company. So, what’s in a name?
Founded in a time when the VM was king, VMTurbo’s purpose was to provide workload control to organizations struggling to maintain performance and efficiency in their virtualized data centers. Fast forward six years, and the IT landscape has expanded tremendously, with each new platform and technology lending an additional layer of complexity to an already n-dimensional challenge.
Join us today, August 17th at 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM as we share with you the largest change our company has been through since our product first launched in 2010: VMTurbo is now Turbonomic. Join us to learn:


	- The story behind Turbonomic
	- How it impacts your journey as a customer and partner


While our name may have changed, our company vision remains the same: enabling our users to manage any workload, on any infrastructure, anywhere, any time – now and in the future.
