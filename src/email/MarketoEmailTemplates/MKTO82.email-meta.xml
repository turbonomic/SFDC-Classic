Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
 
 When the London School of Economics (LSE) sought a solution to make efficiency improvements in its virtualized data center without compromising service levels of applications running in virtual machines, it chose technology from VMTurbo. The secret to LSE&apos;s success  &lt;http://bit.ly/Uhatqm&gt; is a solution that ensures that applications have the physical and virtual IT resources needed, maximizes utilization of infrastructure resources, projects the impact of new workloads and growth on the environment, and reduces the burden on IT staff in their expanding virtualized data center.

You may be facing similar pressures as you expand virtualized servers in your environment and realize that your current management tools can’t meet your requirements. Surely, with initiatives for virtual desktop infrastructure, student and faculty portals, and electronic learning, you have a lot to manage.  That’s why maximizing the efficiency of resources—IT assets and operational staff—to control costs is at the top of your To-Do list.

VMTurbo Operations Manager &lt;http://bit.ly/SY81or&gt; can help. Learn more &lt;http://bit.ly/Uhatqm&gt; and see how your organization could benefit from the use of VMTurbo’s technology.
