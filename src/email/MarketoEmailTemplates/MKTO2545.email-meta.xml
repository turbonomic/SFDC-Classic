Are you going to be attending the Citrix Synergy event next week? If so, I wanted to let you know that Turbonomic will have a booth and extend the invite for you to come and meet the team and see what is new with Turbonomic.  Our booth is number 509 and my colleague AJ Fiore will be there for a majority of the week and would love to put and name to a face. Best,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
