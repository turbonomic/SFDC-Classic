Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Virtualization is now common place in enterprise IT and used very effectively to reduce the time and cost to provision new IT services. 

In the evolution of virtualization adoption and operational maturity  many organizations are now looking how they can drive more benefits by improving user experience whilst virtualizing more complex and mission critical applications &lt;http://bit.ly/VggUXZ&gt;. At the same time there is also growing concern about controlling efficiency and future cost as organizations rapidly scale out their virtual infrastructure.

In virtualized environments these are not simple challenges to address because of the complexity involved in optimally combining workloads on a shared server and storage infrastructure.
