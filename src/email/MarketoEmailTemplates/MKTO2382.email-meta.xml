Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}}, Maximizing performance is vital to the success of hosted virtual applications. Overtax your resources and users will have a degraded experience and underutilizing those resources will lead to wasting money on unnecessary severs. Turbonomic matches real-time application workload demand to infrastructure supply to continuously assure performance, allowing you to do more with less. A recent analysis by Principled Technologies found that by executing Turbonomic’s recommendations, such as reallocation of memory and vCPU, and migrating mission-critical VMs to more efficiently leverage available storage resources, orders per minute completed by the application in Principled Technologies’ virtual test environment increased by 23.7%. Click below to see what Turbonomic&apos;s Autonomic Platform can do for you.
