    <subject>You&apos;re Invited: Houston Executive Networking Event at Minute Maid Park</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

In my more than 20 years both investing in and running enterprise IT companies, I have had the privilege of watching IT go through waves of transformation from a birds-eye view. All previous waves pale in comparison to that which we observe today.

I cordially invite you to join myself and dozens of our fellow IT leaders in Houston for the Houston Executive Networking Event &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-houston/]]&gt;: Elastic Compute At Cloud Economics on Wednesday, September 20th 2017 at Minute Maid Park at 4:00PM. 


Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reinvent their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging and mistakes are costly. We will discuss this unprecedented shift our industry currently faces and how we as the stewards of our generation can lead the innovation charge. It is my goal and hope that this networking opportunity will be intellectually stimulating and beneficial for all.

I look forward to meeting you and participating in an engaging conversation. As space is limited, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-houston/]]&gt; as soon as possible.



Yours sincerely,
Ben
