    <textOnly>HiÂ {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


We wanted to personally thank you for joining the Turbonomic on last Thursday evening at the Golf Club at Chelsea Piers! We had a great time getting to know you, with the added benefit of working on our golf swing, and we hope you did too!
If there is any help that we can provide to you here at Turbonomic, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.

On behalf of Turbonomic - thank you!


We hope to see you again soon!
Megan
