    <subject>DXC &amp; Turbonomic - Automation is the Answer</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

In the first month of using Turbonomic, DXC automated decisions around placement, motion, sizing, and configuration saving them over $1.25 Million and delivering greater innovation to their clients.

 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/videos/dxc-automation-turbonomic-customer-success-story/]]&gt;

&quot;I want to move from thousands to millions of automated decisions as quickly as we can. And both our client and our teams can focus on work that&apos;s ultimately going to pay off in business results for the client. So it&apos;s win-win every which way you look at it.&quot; - Greg Betz, VP Global Operations, DXC
