I was hoping that we could show you why other counties/cities like City of Miami have chosen to implement Turbonomic into their infrastructure, enabling them to increase application performance while also increasing their infrastructure efficiency.  I also wanted to make sure you and the team were aware that for the month of May Turbonomic is offering $15,000 off if a team chooses to go through an evaluation during the month of May. Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction to you and the team over the next couple of weeks?  Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   Going to Cisco Live?
