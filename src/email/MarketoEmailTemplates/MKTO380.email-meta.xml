Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},



VMTurbo just released &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/?p=10092&gt; v4.5. We are extending our control system beyond the hypervisor into the converged fabric and deeper into storage.


 - VMTurbo resolves virtualization performance issues with one click. It tells you the specific actions to take to resolve the issue – which VMs to move, and which hosts to move them to. It will even execute those actions for you.



 - VMTurbo will now calculate actions for NetApp and Cisco UCS &lt;http://bit.ly/1lilXre&gt; such as provisioning new storage controllers, new ports, or spinning up a new blade – all automatically, all optimally.
