I am bringing one of my engineers on the call that is well versed in how Turbo can help around SAN and storage, as I know that is a focus for you. Below is the agenda for the call and the conference bridge info. Feel free to bring any members of your team on the call. Don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions you might have.   Conference bridge info:  Please join my meeting from your computer, tablet or smartphone.
