Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

You are invited to join our Senior Director of Sales Engineering, Eric Horsman, as he demonstrates Turbonomic&apos;s AI-powered migration assessments for Azure on Thursday, July 12th at 11am ET.
 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-azure-migration-assessment/]]&gt;

In this 30-minute live demo session &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-azure-migration-assessment/]]&gt;, you will learn how Turbomonic leverages an understanding of your entire stack - from the application to the hardware layer - to automatically generate a migration assessment that enables IT Teams to compare optimized costs in Azure and AWS.

See you there!
