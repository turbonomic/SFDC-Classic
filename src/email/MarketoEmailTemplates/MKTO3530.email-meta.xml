    <subject>[Live Webinar] 3 Ways to Accelerate AND De-Risk Your Cloud Migration</subject>

Hi {{Lead.First Name:default=There}},


Cloud migrations continue to be a pressing problem for many organizations – from planning, to prioritizing, to executing the migration.

The problem is that the industry-standard approach to planning is little better than guessing. And these guesses lead to poor results – including ballooning cloud costs and performance issues.

What if you knew that your cloud migration plans could run in minutes, understood performance requirements from the application down to the hardware, and only recommended exactly the cloud resources you need, for the optimal cost?


Please join our live webinar on Thursday March 22nd at 1PM ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cloud-migration-webinar/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_migration_webinar]]&gt; to learn from Cloud CTO Mor Cohen and Director of Technical Marketing Eric Wright as they discuss how Turbonomic customers today are radically accelerating AND de-risking their cloud migrations – and then driving continuous optimization from there.
