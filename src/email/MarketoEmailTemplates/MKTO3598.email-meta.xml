    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=friend}},
 
I hope you are doing well and easing nicely into spring. As we approach May, I wanted to personally extend an invitation to our upcoming user group meeting in Atlanta, GA, taking place Wednesday, May 2nd.
 
If you aren’t familiar with the Atlanta Turbonomic User Group, we are a customer-led community, serving as a place for IT professionals to network, share best practices and engage in construction conversations on cutting edge technology trends. We are a community who loves to learn, and I hope you will join us in that journey!
 
I’m pleased to be hosting the next meeting at the Travelport offices – located at 300 Galleria Parkway Northwest. We’ll have a full schedule of working sessions and technology roadmap discussions, and of course, lunch and refreshments will be provided.
 
RSVP today &lt;[[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/atlanta-turbonomic-user-group-tickets-44746324461]]&gt;, and I hope to see you there!

Best,
Steve Senecal
