Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
We’ve built our Green Circle Community &lt;https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/welcome&gt; in an effort to better support and collaborate with our Customers. We also like having fun with our customers! Did you know you get varying numbers of points for participating?  You can redeem these points for some awesome swag or even your very own South Park avatar:


For good reason this is our biggest seller, and for this week only if you register &lt;https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/welcome&gt; for the Green Circle you will be half way there with 125 points!
