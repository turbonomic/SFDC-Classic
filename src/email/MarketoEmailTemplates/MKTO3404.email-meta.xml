    <subject>Are you attending Cisco Live in Barcelona?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
Are you or one of your team attending Cisco Live this year?
 
You may have seen in the news that Cisco have recently released a new product: Cisco Workload Optimization Manager (powered by Turbonomic).
 
Workload Optimization Manager is an intelligent software, designed to automatically manage ANY virtualized infrastructure or cloud environment. The value it brings to customers is as follows:


	- Applications can handle 23% more orders per minute
	- 37% better application response time
	- 24% higher VM:host density
	- 80% less tickets and troubleshooting


These benefits were achieved in a VMWare optimized environment, despite the existing use of VRops and DRS.
 
Cisco IT has been using this product (Turbonomic) for the past two years in their production data centers. Here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/videos/cisco-turbonomic-success-scale-turbonomic-customer-success-story/]]&gt; is a video of Mike Myers, Sr. Director of Cloud &amp; Data Centre talking about its impact. 
 
I will be in Barcelona and would love to meet up to discuss further. Do you have availability?
 
Best Regards
