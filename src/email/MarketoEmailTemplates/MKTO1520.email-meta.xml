Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
The notion of measuring Quality Of Service (QOS) was first seen in telephony and computer networks. We expect a certain quality of voice service and the telephone industry became the first to measure and hold themselves to certain service levels. 
But as we move into more complex services and environments, does this notion of QOS still make sense? Is it even possilbe to measure with today&apos;s complexity?
