Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Too many organizations struggle with their cloud migrations. Without the right tools to evaluate the consumptions of their workloads, teams resort to overprovisioning which is expensive and doesn&apos;t assure performance.

 It doesn&apos;t have to be this way for you and your team. Through AI-powered automation, Turbonomic provides all workloads the exact resources they need, at the right time, and always in accordance with policies.

Check out this blog post  &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/turbonomic-cloud-migration/]]&gt;from our Cloud CTO, Mor Cohen to learn more about how we can help you with migration planning.
Regards,
Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
