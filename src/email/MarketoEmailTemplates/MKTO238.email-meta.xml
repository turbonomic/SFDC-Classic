    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Iâ€™m sorry to have missed you at our wine tasting event at the Harvard Club. I do hope we can connect soon, however, to discuss your virtualization challenges and some exciting new developments here at VMTurbo. I will ask a member of my team to reach out to you in the near term. Of course, please feel free to contact me directly at any time. I look forward to talking with you soon.


 Sincerely,

Lou Shipley
