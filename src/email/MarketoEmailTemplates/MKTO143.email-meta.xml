Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We were sorry to have missed you at VMTurbo’s webinar on February 14th.  Since you signed up but could not attend, we thought you might be interested in a recorded version &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/operations-manager-webcast-thank-you?source=email&gt; of the event.

VMTurbo founder and CTO Shmuel Kliger, and co-founder and vice president of product strategy Yuri Rabover joined me. Shmuel reviewed how Software-Defined Control &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/software-defined-control/&gt; solves the problem of assuring workload performance while utilizing virtual infrastructure resources most efficiently. And Yuri provided an overview and demonstration of our Operations Manager 3.3 revision &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/vmturbo-transforms-it-operations-with-software-defined-control-in-latest-release/&gt;.

The information shared supports our belief that IT operations management needs to be fundamentally changed to allow you to unlock the full value of virtualized infrastructure. By controlling the IT environment in a “healthy” state and simplifying IT operations, our solution transforms IT operations from complex, time- and labor-intensive, reactive, and unpredictable to simple, automated, preventive, and efficient. Our control system for virtual infrastructure ensures consistent service delivery and reduces the capital and operational costs of running virtual data centers.

We look forward to seeing you at one of our upcoming events again soon.

Best regards,
Lauren Whitehouse
