I’ve attached the short breakdown for you to see how this is possible. Very simply, Turbonomic’s control engine automates the decisions that usually fall in the hands of engineers, making hundreds of calculations a minute around sizing and placement of VMs leading to the increased efficiency of the infrastructure and a 40% increase in application response time.  Do you have time to jump on a 15 minute call to discuss this POV further and see if it is something that you would want to take another look at?  Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
