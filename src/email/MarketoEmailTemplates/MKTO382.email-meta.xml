    <subject>Your Invitation to Chill: VIP Cocktail Reception with VMTurbo Following VMworld</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Youâ€™re Invited!

Please join us to discuss how VMTurbo is transforming IT delivery. We will address driving cost down and increasing value to the business. Topics will include software-defined networking and storage; public, private, and hybrid cloud; and the challenge of improving agility while containing costs in this fast-changing landscape.

VMTurbo&apos;s patented Software Defined Control for Virtualized Data Centers allows you to run your environment more efficiently. On average, our customers increase VM density by 20%, saving millions of dollars in opex/capex without degrading performance.

We will be raffling an Xbox One and a PlayStation 4 as a thank you for participating. Please RSVP &lt;http://bit.ly/1hkhpeh&gt; before Thursday, February 13th and look forward to seeing you there.


Sincerely,

{{lead.Lead Owner First Name:default=VMTurbo}}{{lead.Lead Owner Last Name:default=edit me}}
