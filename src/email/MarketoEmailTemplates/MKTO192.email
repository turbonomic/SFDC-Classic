<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Are you open for a follow up meeting to discuss key takeaways from the Modern Infrastructure event last week?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As our founder, Shmuel  Kliger, outlined during his talk, 
  VMTurbo reduces the costs and risks associated with virtualization / cloud initiatives by delivering a <a href="http://bit.ly/10cctnM">different approach</a> to managing virtualized IT.
    Our philosophy is focused on achieving software-defined control to maintain the environment in an optimal state &ndash;think of it like a virtual health check--so that you can experience fewer incidents, achieve higher density, and deliver projects in less time and with better certainty of    
performance and efficiency.&nbsp; You can check out <a href="http://go.vmturbo.com/wp-improved-approach-to-virtualization-management-download.html?source=email">this paper</a> for more detail.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Again please  let me know when   
you are available for a quick discussion about how our fundamentally better approach to IT Operations will enable you to achieve your business and operational goals.
 </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To Your Virtual Health,</span></p>
