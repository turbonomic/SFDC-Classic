Take The VMTurbo Challenge.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Overprovisioning and firefighting are the struggles of Olde World IT.

Welcome to the New World.

We challenge your existing operations manager to a duel. Complete your activation of the VMTurbo Operations Manager trial &lt;http://bit.ly/1o95lOP&gt;, and watch as VMTurbo automatically drives your environment to its optimal state. No thresholds to set. No keeping guard. Just sitting back as your existing ops manager marvels at VMTurbo&apos;s ability to control the entire environment.

&lt;http://bit.ly/1kpxFMy&gt;


Don&apos;t have time for the VMTurbo Challenge? Contact us &lt;sales@vmturbo.com&gt; at your convenience to schedule a live demo; we are more than happy to help.
With thanks from the New World,
VMTurbo
