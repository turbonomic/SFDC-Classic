    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

Thank you for registering for the Turbonomic and Microsoft Azure Webinar last week on November 1, 2017. If you attended the webinar live, we hope we were able to answer some questions for you on how Turbonomic can help you make the most of your Microsoft Azure investment.

If you were not able to make it (or just want to check out the recording or slides again), we&apos;ve packaged it all together for you to review. &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/thank-you-turbonomic-azure-webinar/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=turbonomic_azure_webcast]]&gt;

Want to learn more about Turbonomic and Microsoft Azure? Take a look at this new whitepaper &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cost-optimization-with-azure/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Performance_and_Cost_Optimization_with_Azure]]&gt; we created, which provides insight into how you can minimize costs within Azure while maintaining performance.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out at marketing@turbonomic.com. &lt;[[mailto:marketing@turbonomic.com]]&gt;

We hope you enjoy!
