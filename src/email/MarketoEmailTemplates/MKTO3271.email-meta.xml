   At the end of the 60-day license:   
 	- A representative from your company will attend a 30-minute Zoom/WebEx to allow us to capture data on improvements delivered by Turbonomic. 	- A representative from your company will attend a 30-minute Zoom/WebEx to allow us to present back to you and your organisation the improvements that Turbonomic has delivered.
