    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

Of course, if at any time you want to accelerate your learning, you can visit the Green Circle Community &lt;[[https://greencircle.turbonomic.com/welcome?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ENG-HybridCloud&amp;utm_content=Mid03]]&gt; and gain tips and tricks from real Turbonomic customers and evaluators just like you.
Feature #3: Supply Chain


Turbonomic abstracts and represents the data center and all its entities as a supply chain of buyers and sellers of resources. The output of their transactions is a series of Actions that guarantee performance. The Supply Chain shows their relationships, and helps you answer the following questions:



	- What are the relationships among all entities in my environment?
	- Which ones need attention?


Step-By-Step: Supply Chain





The following steps will guide you through the Supply Chain tab:



	- Navigator arrows represent the Buyer-Seller relationships between types of entities
	- Click any entity type in the Navigator to populate this section with all the entities in that class; Red = Overutilized, Green = Desired Utilization, Blue = Underutilized
	- Click any entity in the Navigator to populate the Related section with details about the selected item and its supply chain

	- The purple box represents the current Utilization Index (UI)* and the green box represents the Utilization Index after related actions in the To Do section are executed

	- Utilization plots the utilization levels for each resource consumed by the selected entity, over time. Slide the carrots to adjust the time period displayed by the plot.



*Utilization Index (UI) is Turbonomic&apos;s calculation of the relative price of an entity in the data center. UI ranges from 1 to 20,000.
