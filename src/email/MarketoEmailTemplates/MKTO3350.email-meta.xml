Hi {{Lead.First Name}},


Are you attending KubeCon in Austin next week? We are! And, we would love to meet you at our booth! Stop by booth S39 for a demo of self-managing Kubernetes powered by Turbonomic. We’ll also be demoing our hot-off-the-press integration with StackPointCloud for turnkey deployment of self-managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS or Azure. We hope to see you there!
 
In the meantime, check out this Red Hat blog from our team: Self-Managing OpenShift with Turbonomic &lt;[[https://blog.openshift.com/self-managing-openshift-turbonomic/]]&gt;. It includes a demo video of how Turbonomic works with OpenShift (which, if you didn’t already know runs on Kubernetes. ;-))
