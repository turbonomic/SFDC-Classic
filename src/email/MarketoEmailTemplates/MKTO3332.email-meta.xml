    <subject>You&apos;re Invited: Tampa Bay Executive Networking Game Lightning vs Sharks</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

I cordially invite you to join myself and our technology in Tampa for the upcoming Tampa Bay Executive Networking Game &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/vip-tampabay/]]&gt; on Saturday, December 2nd 2017 at the home of the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Amalie Arena at 6:30PM. 



This event is a great opportunity to meet with peers, share challenges, and discuss trends heading into the new year. In addition to food, drinks, and of course hockey as the Lightning take on the Sharks. It is my goal and hope that this networking opportunity will be intellectually stimulating and beneficial for all. 

I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. As space is limited, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/vip-tampabay/]]&gt; as soon as possible.



Yours sincerely,
Dave
