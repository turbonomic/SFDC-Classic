Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

What would it mean for your career if you could deliver:


	- Application response time improvements of 35%
	- And increasing datacenter utilization by at least 30%
	- While simultaneously saving up to 40% on your cloud bills?



These results aren’t magic – they’re AI-powered automation. Our new release, Turbonomic 6.1 &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/introducing-turbonomic-6-1]]&gt;, is loaded with features that not only enhance workload efficiency and performance but also make it easier to get started on your automation journey.

Join our live webinar on Thursday, June 7th at 2pm GMT &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/using-ai-to-cut-cloud-costs/]]&gt; to learn how Turbonomic’s AI-powered decision engine continuously optimizes RI recommendations in concert with resizing automation – to drive the elasticity AND cost savings you want and expect from the cloud.
