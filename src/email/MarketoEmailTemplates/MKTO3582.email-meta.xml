    <subject>Choosing Between AWS and Azure? Learn How Turbonomic Enables a Data-Driven Decision</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/choosing-between-aws-and-azure-webinar/]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

We have daily conversations with teams who are struggling to figure out which cloud is the best fit for their applications – AWS or Azure – and how much it would cost if they migrated.

Turbonomic Cloud Migration planning is fast and accurate, enabling you to run intelligent, data-backed analysis of which cloud (or clouds) fits your applications best, while also considering your existing licensing arrangements.

To learn how you can choose the best cloud for your applications, register for our upcoming Live Webinar scheduled for Thursday, April 26th at 11am ET.

 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/choosing-between-aws-and-azure-webinar/]]&gt;

Can you imagine if, in a matter of days, you could clearly compare your true application costs across:


	- AWS On Demand or Reserved Instances (RIs)
	- Azure On Demand or Reserved Instances (RIs)
	- AWS Dedicated Instances (leverage many existing licenses)
	- Azure Hybrid Benefit (leverage existing Microsoft licenses)



Once you register for the webinar, check out the blog post we just published &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/choosing-between-aws-and-azure/]]&gt; on this very topic.

We look forward to seeing you on the webinar!
