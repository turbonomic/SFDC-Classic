<p><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times;"><font size="2">Hi&nbsp;Andy,</font></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times;"><font size="2">I hope all is well. I'm not sure if you are a baseball fan, but I wanted to let you know that we are running a special promotion for meeting with us over the next month. If you complete an introductory meeting with Turbonomic before June 23rd, we will enter you in a raffle to win a trip for two (2) to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game in Miami, Florida from July 9 - 12, 2017. </font></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times;"><font size="2">After doing a bit of research around your role at Epicor, I'm confident you would see value in Turbonomic. Turbonomic’s autonomic workload management platform frees up operations, infrastructure, architecture and engineering teams from manual management and planning within any cloud or on-prem environment, enabling you to work more effectively together as you pursue strategic initiatives. We’d like to show you how - and give you an opportunity to watch the best baseball players in the league come together for an unforgettable event. </font></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times;"><font size="2">If you’d like to be entered, you can <a href="https://turbonomic.com/mlb-all-star-experience-giveaway/" target="_blank" id="">visit this page</a>, or just let me know and I will work with you directly to schedule our meeting and put you into the raffle. </font></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times;"><font size="2">Best,</font></span></p>
