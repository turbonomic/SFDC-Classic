Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Congratulations! You&apos;re a genius. You&apos;ve just downloaded the world&apos;s most advanced virtualization management software, the VMTurbo Operations Manager. You&apos;re on your way to ramping up VM density and achieving previously impossible utilization rates, all while assuring application performance like never before.

Life is about the change. CAPEX and OPEX are going down, along with your frustrations. Like we said, you’re a genius. It’s time to own your environment.
Looking forward to your success,
VMTurbo
