Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
Thanks for taking the time to come by and see us at the VMware User Group in Chicago. As a follow-up to the event, I&apos;ve linked below a few of the many resources designed to dive deeper into the ways VMTurbo will dramatically improve how you control and automate your virtual data center.

- Trial Download &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; - check out VMTurbo in your environment, absolutely free
- Whitepaper &lt;http://bit.ly/17GQhjy&gt; on optimizing workload configurations in your virtual environment

My team will be following up with you shortly to understand your priorities and interest in learning more about VMTurbo.


Sincerely,
