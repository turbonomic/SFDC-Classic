    <subject>2/3 of x86 Workloads Are Virtualized. Get to 100%.</subject>
    <textOnly>You Can Virtualize Everything.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

According to a June 2013 Gartner report, Magic Quadrant for x86 Server Virtualization Infrastructure, two-thirds of x86 server workloads are virtualized, and rightfully so. As virtualization architectures make the datacenter ever more efficient and elastic, so too do they make the datacenter ever more complex.

Though hypervisor vendors have made much progress in the delivery of virtualization technology, their management tools fall short. Not only are such tools limited to a single brand, perpetuating vendor lock, but also apply simplistic single-metric approaches to software-defined management, doing little to proactively mitigate application performance risk.

VMTurbo Operations Manager shatters the mold. Contact us for a demo &lt;http://bit.ly/1prbRFy&gt;, and witness hardware agnostic, hypervisor agnostic, holistic datacenter management. Have you ever seen a datacenter successfully virtualize 100%? We have.
