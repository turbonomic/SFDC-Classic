    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir or Madam}}:
It is my pleasure to cordially invite you to VMTurbo&apos;s second annual Turbofest London at The Royal Institution. This afternoon event will be held on Thursday, May 19th at 21 Albemarle St, London W1S 4BS with presentations starting at 1:00 PM.
The program features cloud and virtualisation thought leadership discussions, customer keynotes, and an inside look at the 2016 VMTurbo Roadmap. The evening will conclude at 7:00 PM following networking, cocktails, and a science demonstration that is sure to be explosive!
Due to space considerations, Turbofest London is limited to the first 100 VIP registrants. I look forward to seeing you there.
