Next week, Presidio and Turbonomic will be hosting the Boston Executive Networking Dinner: &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-boston/]]&gt; Elastic Compute at Cloud Economics on Thursday, 
September 21st 2017 at the Downtown Harvard Club of Boston at 5:00PM EST.


There are very limited seats available and I wanted to make sure that you had a moment to RSVP &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-boston/]]&gt;. Many renown New England Executives will be in 
attendance to network and exchange ideas around hybrid and public cloud strategies. 

After a dinner full of hybrid cloud discussion (and Executive Chef Dean A. Moore critically acclaimed menu) all attendees will be treated to a home automation kit encompassing of an Amazon Echo or a Nest Thermostat. 

While you RSVP &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-boston/]]&gt;, take a sneak peek at the amazing partnership we, at Turbonomic have forged with BMC &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_IGHTGVR6U&amp;t=12s]]&gt;. Listen to how Scott Crowder utilizes Turbonomic to increase overall capacity by 25% and drive “performance through the roof”.
