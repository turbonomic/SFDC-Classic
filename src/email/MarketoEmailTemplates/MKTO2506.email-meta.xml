I’ve worked with a number of governmental institutions including Georgetown University, and Boston College to alleviate their IT infrastructure management challenges. They generally run within a June/July budget cycle and occasionally have remaining funds towards the end of their fiscal year. I typically find that customers in the higher ed industry see the most value in Turbonomic’s ability to:
	- Reduce ongoing compute/storage costs by 20-30% by optimizing workload placement	- Reduce operational costs of problem and incident management by eliminating complex problems with disk space and IO performance contention	- Assure application performance and reduce risk by minimizing the contention for CPU, Mem, disk space and IO capacity	- Enable more IO-intensive applications to be virtualized reliably, bringing down the overall cost to deliver compute services to the business and customers
 Turbonomic directly addresses both of these challenges through our intelligent automation, enabling teams to increase the infrastructure’s capacity and the performance of the applications they run (see more in link in signature). With that in mind, we’d like to offer a $15,000 discount for any deal with us, if you install Turbonomic’s autonomic performance platform before the end of May. 
Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction to you and the team at University of Maryland – Baltimore County over the next couple of weeks?  Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  Going to Cisco Live?
