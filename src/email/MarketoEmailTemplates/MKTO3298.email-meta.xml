Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Last week we shared with you our e-book The State of Multi-Cloud Architecture: Part One &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/thx-wp-the-state-of-multi-cloud-part-1/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=state_of_multi_cloud_pt_1]]&gt;, part of a survey series we collaborated on with Verizon to establish a baseline for where organizations reside on their journey to the hybrid cloud.
This week we&apos;re bringing to you The State of Multi-Cloud Architecture: Part Two, where we look to continue the conversation and address what can go wrong, and what does go wrong when implementing Multi-Cloud?
In this E-Book we provide detailed insights and analysis on:


	- Implementation Challenges

	- Vendor Selection

	- Technical and business requirements facing multi-cloud adoption
