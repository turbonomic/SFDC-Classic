    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Here are some options to make a connection:


	- Meet the team from Turbonomic at our booth (#P11) &lt;[[https://turbonomic.jifflenow.com/kubeconbarcelona2019/external_request/53bfbd]]&gt; and learn about our continuous optimization of Kubernetes services for DevOps
	- Skip the queue and book a meeting with our technical staff &lt;[[https://turbonomic.jifflenow.com/kubeconbarcelona2019/external_request/53bfbd]]&gt; here

We hope to see you there.

Regards,
 Andrew
