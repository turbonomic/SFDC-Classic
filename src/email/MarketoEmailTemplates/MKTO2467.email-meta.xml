{{lead.First Name:default=there}},
We are aware that you get hundreds of emails each week from vendors, which is why we wanted to take a moment to let you know we understand your time is extremely valuable and extend an offer to partner with you to support a cause that is close to you.
We recently launched our Financial Services IT Maturity Survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NTZ6RBT?marketo_cr6r585pkg=[marketo_cr6r585pkg_value]&amp;marketo_phigpw5xy8=[marketo_phigpw5xy8_value]]]&gt;, to better understand the challenges faced in achieving your IT goals, and are offering a $25 Amazon gift card for completing the 5 minute survey by May 26th. We are also offering $100 Amazon gift card for agreeing to a 30 minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer (meeting must within 10 days of survey submission). If you cannot accept a gift card, we will make a $100 donation to the 501(c)(3) charity of your choice.
We look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about the benefits Turbonomic can bring to your infrastructure!
