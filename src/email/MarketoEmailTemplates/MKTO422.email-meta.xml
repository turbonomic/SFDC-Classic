    <subject>VMTurbo Trial: What has your evaluation exposed?</subject>
    <textOnly>   
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


At this point in your VMTurbo Operations Manager trial, you should be learning some interesting things about your virtual environment, including areas of performance risk and opportunities to improve efficiency.  I’d like to share some resources with you to make sure you wring out the most efficiency in your trial.

Check out the video demonstration for the Discover phase &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/eval-tutorial-discover/&gt; of using VMTurbo in the Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/resources/evaluation-resource-center/&gt;. In addition to documenting and identifying the current state of the environment in the Operations Manager Inventory tab, you will learn more about navigating the Home tab, and understand how to customize views and reports.

We’d also like to invite you to subscribe to the VMTurbo blog &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/blog1/&gt; so we can keep you informed regarding virtualization management issues. Or, if you’d prefer to just reach us when needed, please contact support &lt;http://support.vmturbo.com/home&gt;, or feel free to get in touch with me.

Thank you,

VMTurbo</textOnly>
