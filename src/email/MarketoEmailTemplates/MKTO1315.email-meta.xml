    <subject>Your VMTurbo Free Trial Ends Today</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{Lead.First Name}},
Your VMTurbo free control ends today, your trial will be downgraded to our free Virtual Health Monitor Tool. You will still be able to monitor your environment for free, but we all know simple monitoring doesn&apos;t compare to control.
The real question you have to answer is, are you really going to go back to fighting fires? Have you been missing those 3 a.m. alerts? No? Good, we didn&apos;t think so - say &quot;No&quot; to drowning in alerts and dashboards and &quot;Yes&quot; to control.
Schedule a 30-minute demo today. Our team of experts will give you a personalized walk through of VMTurbo, showing you just how VMTurbo will drive your environment to perpetual health.
