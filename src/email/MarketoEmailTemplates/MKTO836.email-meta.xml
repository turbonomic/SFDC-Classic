Dear Matthew,

Thank you.

I cannot adequately express my gratitude for your attendance and participation in last week’s first annual Octurbofest user group. For VMTurbo as a company, there could be no experience more humbling than to share a day with the early adopting – and actively considering – individuals who will undoubtedly propel the field of IT into a new era of promise and innovation.

I hope that we delivered everything you wanted from the day, that this was merely one touch point in a longer dialogue, and that the momentum brings you back a year hence.

How &apos;bout them Bruins?

Sincerely,

J. Benjamin H. Nye
 CEO

VMTurbo, Inc.
