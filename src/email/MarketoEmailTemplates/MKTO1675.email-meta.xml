    <subject>WEBINAR POSTPONED: Nike &amp; VMTurbo How Nike Maintains VDI Performance and Health Across Continents</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Unlike the data center, not everything can always be in our control. Unfortunately, due to unforseen circumstances, our webinar today with Nike is being postponed.
We apologize for the inconvenience, and are working to reschedule as quickly as possible.
Weâ€™d like to offer all registrants a free VMTurbo Engineer3 t-shirt while we reschedule. If you are interested, please respond to this email with your shirt size and shipping address.
Stay tuned for more information.
- The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
