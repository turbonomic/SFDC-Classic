    <textOnly>Hi Corey,   Hope all is well.   I wanted to reach out and reconnect following our positive conversation back in March as you had mentioned that early summer would be a better time to reconnect in regards to Turbonomic.    To recap, we are working with customers in your space such as Dot Foods &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-DotFoods-Success-Story.pdf]]&gt; Coca-Cola etc. to reduce the cost, risk and complexity within their virtual environment by dynamically allocating resources based on what your applications demand, at any given time— not more, not less. This will help your team better support the business as it will make sure that mission critical applications get the resources that they need, when they need them— but not by over provisioning and being inefficient.    I remember there being a lot of interest around our automation and ability to execute these decisions in order to proactively manage your environment and assure performance at the lowest possible cost.    Do you have some time to reconnect and discuss Turbo as well as timeline?   Best,   Alex
