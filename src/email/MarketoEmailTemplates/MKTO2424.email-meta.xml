    <subject>$15,000 Off Turbonomic for State and Local Institutions (1494860510.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Thomas, 

I’m reaching out with a special offer for State and Local Government organizations as we approach the summer months. I’ve worked with a number of  cities, towns and counties including Orange County Schools, and Seminole County Schools to alleviate their IT infrastructure management challenges. They generally run within a July budget cycle and occasionally have remaining funds towards the end of their fiscal year.
I typically find these customers bear one of two prevalent problems:

	- Their IT environments are highly fragmented, marked by high inefficiency and/or Their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resources.	- Their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resources.
Turbonomic directly addresses both of these challenges.
With that in mind, we’d like to offer a $15,000 discount for any deal with us, if you install Turbonomic’s autonomic performance platform before the end of May. 
Do you have 30 minutes for my team and I to provide an introduction to you and the team at Pinellas County Schools over the next couple of weeks? 

Best regards,
