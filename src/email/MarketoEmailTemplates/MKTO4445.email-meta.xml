    <subject>Are you Optimizing Kubernetes the Easy Way?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


If you’re thinking about Kubernetes challenges at scale, ask yourself:



	- Am I simultaneously managing performance, cost, and compliance?

	- Should I be doing this, or can software do it for me?

	- If software did this for me, what would I do differently?




Turbonomic software optimizes Kubernetes for you. It’s like a full-time brain totally focused on assuring application performance while maintaining compliance, and minimizing cost. You get to focus on the bigger stuff.
