    <subject>Four ideas for 2014 virtualization initiatives</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Virtualization management is like an open book test – the challenging part is finding the solution, not the solution itself.  In the spirit of sharing good ideas, we asked our favorite gurus (our customers) how they were budgeting to run more efficiently:


 - JPMorgan will use placement automation to reduce manhours by keeping environments healthy
 - First Canadian Title will pack VDI instances more efficiently
 - Southern Waste is extending hardware life
 - BT&apos;s enterprise virtual datacenter is perfectly sized to assure VM performance
