Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Managing the virtualized environment of today is significantly more complex than just keeping the plates spinning.  There are important business needs and goals that must be met:


 - Assure continuous performance for all applications—especially business-critical ones
 - Make the best use of the physical infrastructure because it directly affects operating costs
 - Develop a forward-looking cost/benefit analysis for hardware refresh, higher VM density, and infrastructure growth


VMTurbo offers bi-weekly webinars with a live demonstration of VMTurbo Operations Manager in a group setting that allow you to explore how we can help you address these challenges. Sign up &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/events/vmturbo-bi-weekly-live-demo-series/&gt; for one today. If you’d prefer a one-on-one experience with one of our support engineers, you can schedule a demo &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/request-a-demo.html&gt;.

Thank you,
