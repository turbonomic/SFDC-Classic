HiÂ {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
One of the biggest challenges in virtualized infrastructure impacting application performance is the ability to manage resource contention in the underlying storage infrastructure. A common approach to reduce the impact of this challenge is to over-provision storage platforms with IO and disk capacity and manage mission-critical applications in silos.
The adoption of SSD all-flash arrays tends to eliminate the IO bottleneck, as all-flash offer 10x+ the IOPS capacity. However, the challenge of workload alignment, heterogeneous storage management, and efficient capacity planning remain when introducing SSD arrays into virtual &amp; cloud environments. So, how can we overcome all of these tough challenges?
The paper below answers these questions and explores storage virtualization in-depth.
