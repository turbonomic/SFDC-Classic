I was compelled to connect the two of you as Gary has been meeting with Enterprise CIO’s across the country and the reviews have been outstanding.  In February Turbonomic announced &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg64489CW64k8B48p-YpCW1pNgV-56dCG-f2BGZDK02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fturbonomic.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fformer-ge-cio-gary-reiner-joins-turbonomic-board%2F&amp;si=6523056037822464&amp;pi=7b3d58ce-f55f-499a-99ff-79ad9a6b73ea]]&gt; $50 million in additional funding, led by General Atlantic and Mr. Reiner, current Operating Partner at General Atlantic, and newest member of Turbonomic’s Board of Directors.   In a brief call you could hear why Gary and General Atlantic decided to back Turbonomic and its more than 1,600 CIO’s in ensuring maximum performance, efficiency, and resiliency in their hybrid clouds and data centers. (ie. The Mayo Clinic, Houston Methodist, Molina Healthcare, etc. among 1,600+ others) Mr. Reiner, who says Turbonomic is “on the right side of history,” brings with him a deep understanding of the challenges faced by CIOs in assuring application performance and maintaining a competitive advantage through implementing innovative IT strategies.  Turbonomic plans to invest a significant portion of this funding in product development, particularly around hybrid cloud management and on-premises infrastructure efficiency. Both the fundraising and growth of Turbonomic’s Board were profiled in Forbes &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg64489CW64k8B48p-YpCW1pNgV-56dCG-f2BGZDK02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Falexkonrad%2F2017%2F01%2F23%2Fturbonomic-raises-50-mil-from-general-atlantic%2F&amp;si=6523056037822464&amp;pi=7b3d58ce-f55f-499a-99ff-79ad9a6b73ea]]&gt;. When would be the best time to schedule a 30 minute conversation? Best Regards,Maggie  Margaret Schroeder - Turbonomic
