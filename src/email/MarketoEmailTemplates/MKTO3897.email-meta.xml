Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Deciding to move your workloads to the cloud is easy, but what&apos;s hard is deciding how. By first optimizing workloads prior to migrating them to Azure, and then continuously optimizing workloads, you can assure cloud applications get the resources they need to perform, at optimal cost, and in compliance with policies. 


Please join us for a live webinar presentation and demo illustrating how you can deliver fast, accurate AI-powered migration assessments and continuous optimization for Azure including compute, storage, and Azure SQL.

 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-azure/?utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=azure-webinar]]&gt;

In this 30-minute live webinar, Mor Cohen-Tal, Chief Technology Officer of Cloud, will teach you a new approach to deliver the fastest, most accurate assessments for Azure migration.


I hope to see you there!</textOnly>
