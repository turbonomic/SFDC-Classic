Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We hope to see you at the upcoming VMUG Winter Warmer at Gillette Stadium this week! We know your day is likely filling up quickly with the various technical sessions, demonstrations and exhibits offered. That’s why we’re reaching out. We’d like to make sure VMTurbo is at the top of your agenda.

 
VMTurbo Operations Manager analyzes the real-time performance characteristics, resource capacity, system constraints and service level priorities across the virtual data center to determine, implement and adjust resource configurations and workload placement. By doing so, VMTurbo helps you meet service levels and business goals, preventing performance bottlenecks while maximizing resource efficiency. We&apos;ll make you—and your environment—more productive.

Attend our session at 1:30pm, 2:30pm and 3:30pm in Room Blue 12 titled, “Stop Guessing and Start Automating: How to Guarantee VM Performance and Maximize Utilization?” Here’s a preview &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/esevideo/&gt; of what we do.

We hope to see you there!
