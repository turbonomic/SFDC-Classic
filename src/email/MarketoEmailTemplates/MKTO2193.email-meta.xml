As discussed, below are some materials for the team to look through as well as my contact info if they are interested in learning more. Thank you for the help!    Our control platform does what VMWare’s VRops and VSphere &lt;[[https://vmturbo.wistia.com/medias/r67l1kk7i5]]&gt; can’t because our autonomic engine gives the intelligence to virtual machines to size and place themselves within the environment, allowing teams to keep their environment in a perpetual state of health, enabling teams to: Assure Application Performance in Real Time o   80% decrease in tickets and alerts (become more operationally efficient) o   Preventing problems before they become issues (we are the only platform that does this) Drive Efficiency in Environment  o   40% increase in VM/Host Density as workloads get the intelligence to dictate the resources they need, saving hundreds of thousands of CapEx in the infrastructure.Capacity Plano   Forecasting and tons of “what-if” scenarios around h/w refresh, DC moves, Consolidations etc...To quote Mike Campbell, VP of Hosted Operation at ACI, “It’s not a difficult story to tell. I feel strongly regarding the value of Turbonomic. It’s a must in an environment of any size.”  Turbonomic: Solving the SDDC Management Problem &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/blog/on-turbonomic/solving-sddc-management-problem/]]&gt;  Turbonomic ROI &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_ROI.pdf]]&gt; Principle Technologies: Turbonomic Improves Application Performance  &lt;[[http://t.sidekickopen69.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgdVn3dW8qSQCx76hVPRN72kTf31sBwYf7xKJSz03?t=https%3A%2F%2Fturbonomic.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fprincipled-technologies-vmturbo-improve-application-performance%2F&amp;si=6013571735748608&amp;pi=0746823d-c1d0-407a-9e5a-0c84204c0246]]&gt;  Best,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   </textOnly>
