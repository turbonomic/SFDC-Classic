Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Capacity planning in your virtual data center is no longer an exercise that can be performed every six months. It needs to be an iterative analysis done hand-in-hand with your operations team to allow you to maximize utilization while accommodating your growing workload demands.

Stop using spreadsheets and tools that take a “fill the slot” approach and fail to focus on meeting actual workload requirements. Save time and money with our Free Capacity Optimization &amp; Planning Tool. &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/capacity-planner-download.html&gt;

Done right, capacity planning will reduce performance problems in the short term and save you significant hardware and software licensing fees down the road. For a limited time, we are offering a 30-day trial of our capacity planning and optimization product. The virtual appliance requires less than 30 minutes of your time to get running. Download it here &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/capacity-planner-download.html&gt; for free.
