Subject: Turbonomic intro for Brandsmart  Fernando, My team and I met with Vincent about a month ago to introduce him to Turbonomic and he mentioned that you would be the next best person to reach out to in regards to next steps for introducing Turbonomic to the rest of the Brandsmart team.  I wanted to reach out to you directly to see if you have any time over the next few weeks to have an hour long call for an overview of Turbonomic and discuss how it could be beneficial for you and the team at Brandsmart.  Do you have any availability over the next two weeks for an introduction?  Best,   James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  Going to Cisco Live?
