If you complete an introductory meeting with Turbonomic before June 23rd, we will enter you in a raffle to win a trip for two (2) to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game in Miami, Florida from July 9 - 12, 2017. Turbonomic’s autonomic workload management platform frees up operations, infrastructure, architecture and engineering teams from manual management and planning within any cloud or on-prem environment, enabling you to work more effectively together as you pursue strategic initiatives. We’d like to show you how - and give you an opportunity to watch the best baseball players in the league come together for an unforgettable event.  If you’d like to be entered, you can visit this page &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jE1TcMTPLVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhPBE%2DzVD%2DxiKTUfZRud7V%2DyY9k%2D73jzWkB943El0TYG05TbUVdfAC1R6YZ1jHsAKQKDS6d%5FiPDAqEzng8Ejo0w0cOSSZqj1Vej7Gjywj2jEHRpyuWT42aPXM1Qv%2DZUk3UW4mk8R%2DvMxBiV75sLpQgipfVZhzE88NtIOcs6sEqIUwL33rfVWuw8TqaLwrumjdUbPh06oZMsdjfFKGyeGrPKIDZ32T3drzg3aA1GECljBLY7kELUrUJDVcEMSBKtmjABzG0s5K9d%2DYH0mArARUnjHQL8hges%5FlySIYIL4FyrrI4szAuKbF6ouak%2C/j09SdsDLK1lNoVdlsbPWJbvomjvDc4qrt7kzH%5Fryx9081gZ9feGAPVn7jcFfHZ5%5FaeCQCkwaAIBgnxlKFr2daJRQ6bAOKgTgfn6tprXPfY9Bf7t%2D1cIv%5FKeonTIjp9GA313ABQIdVHB%2DKQOFeboyjTjpM5VuWAqR%5F3rWNJ5mzg5OiLYQ6Yakdu7m40aB3n7MzzS4YWlpwdWC%2DlqPD7VGjYcXpXEG7AR1cPbk6zr%2Dl%2D4IvA0NwP9upClI3%5F1%2DFc4tszfMDQA%2C]]&gt;, or just let me know and I will work with you directly to schedule our meeting and put you into the raffle.    Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
