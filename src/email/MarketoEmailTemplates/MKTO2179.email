<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Per your role at ***COMPANY***, I wanted to reach out and see if I could interest you in learning about a solution that can help your team team augment your E-commerce platform. Turbonomic is currently working with customers including Rue La La, Expedia and Wayfair to improve end user experience while also saving their teams time and energy, and I’m confident we can do the same at ***Company***.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The base of our conversation would include how Turbonomic can enable your team to:</span></p> 
<ul>

<li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Leverage your existing infrastructure as efficiently as possible</span></li> 
<li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">One study found that a 1-second delay in webpage response time can impact overall sales conversions by 7%</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I’ve included a whitepaper that might be of particular interest to you and your team: <a href="http://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic_Empowering-Ecommerce-Against-Unpredictable-Demand.pdf" target="_blank" id="">Empowering E-Commerce against Unpredictable Demand</a></span></p>
