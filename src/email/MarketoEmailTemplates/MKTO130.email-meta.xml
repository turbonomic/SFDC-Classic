    <subject>VMTurbo Named Forbes Most Promising Company</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
 
 I hope you are well and apologize for the interruption here. I wanted to take a quick moment to thank and congratulate you (at the same time) for trusting in VMTurbo to help you better control and optimize your virtual infrastructure.
 
Why? Well, yesterday we were selected by Forbes as one of the Top 100 Most Promising Companies &lt;http://www.forbes.com/most-promising-companies/list/&gt; in America. For innovative software companies like ours, getting early adopters to recognize the need to approach an old problem with a unique solution is important – but getting them to “take the leap” and bet on your company is what really matters. And you all jumped with us – then championed us and helped us improve how our product delivers on that promise. So, a massive “thank you!” from all of us here at VMTurbo. And, while the award itself is no way the end goal, we wanted to share the acceptance with you as well – thus the “congratulations”. Without you all seeing the light, we would just be a bunch of folks with a novel idea (and a failed company).

I&apos;d love to hear how you are doing with our product - and if you are up for doing a success story we&apos;d certainly appreciate that, too.
 
Best regards,

Derek Slayton
