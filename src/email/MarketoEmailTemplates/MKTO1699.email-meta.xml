Your business can run on the hardware it has today.
Most enterprise data centers are grossly over-provisioned because they lack the necessary management tool to maximize hardware utilization while consistently meeting SLA&apos;s.

We&apos;re offering you that tool today, 100% free.

Please forward this email to whomever is requesting new hardware &lt;{{system.forwardToFriendLink:default=edit me}}&gt;. If they install a FREE, 30-Day instance of VMTurbo Operations Manager &lt;http://bit.ly/1hp3s1S&gt;, we will show them how to increase hardware utilization by as much as 50%.

You don&apos;t need more hardware. We can help you soar with what you have.


Dear IT Guy or Gal:

Thank you for considering a trial instance of VMTurbo. What we’ve seen across 600 customers, is that VMTurbo helps you run just as effectively on your existing hardware, as if you were to over-provision your datacenter. Recently, we helped a huge NY bank prove that they could run the exact same workload on 45% fewer servers. We do this by identifying the areas of risk in your virtual environment, making recommendations for ways to remove that risk, and then ensuring that your environment stays in its most efficient state.

Please let us show you the way to IT enlightenment. Download a FREE, 30-Day instance of VMTurbo Operations Manager &lt;http://bit.ly/1hp3s1S&gt;, and we will show you just how much more your existing hardware can do for your business. You&apos;ll need that floor space for the hero statue {{company.company name}} erects in your honor.
