Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We were sorry to have missed you at VMTurbo’s webinar on January 22nd with cloud experts from industry analyst firm Ovum and cloud service provider Layered Tech.  We have a recording &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/Ovum-LayeredTech-webcast.html&gt; of the event that you 
might find useful and interesting.

As more organizations embrace virtualization and cloud architectures to improve IT services, they encounter challenges in consistently delivering high-quality services while getting the most out of their infrastructure investment. VMTurbo believes there is an opportunity to rethink the approach to IT operations management to address these challenges.

VMTurbo provides a control system that ensures applications have the resources required to meet business demands at the lowest operational and capital costs. Unlike monitoring and reporting tools, VMTurbo Operations Manager automates decision-making, prescribing actions to assure performance while maximizing resource utilization. Try it for yourself. &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/downloads&gt;

We hope you will join us at one of our upcoming events soon.

Sincerely,

Lauren Whitehouse, Director of Product Marketing</textOnly>
