I’ve worked with a number of cities including City of Miami, and Orange County (to name local Florida customers) to alleviate their IT management challenges. They generally run within a June or July budget cycle and occasionally have remaining funds towards the end of their fiscal year. I typically find these customers bear one of two prevalent problems:·          ·         Their IT environments are highly fragmented, marked by high inefficiency and/or·         Their staff is limited, thinly spread and under-resourced. Turbonomic directly addresses both of these challenges. With that in mind, we’d like to offer a $15,000 discount for any deal with us, if you install Turbonomic’s autonomic performance platform before the end of May. You can find the free 30-day trial here &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturbonomic.com%2Fdownloads%2Fturbonomic-30-day-trial%2F]]&gt; or by visiting turbonomic.com/downloads/turbonomic-30-day-trial/. Do you have time in the coming month or so for a quick discussion around the benefits that you and the team at City of St. Petersburg could see after installing Turbonomic into your environment.  Best, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
