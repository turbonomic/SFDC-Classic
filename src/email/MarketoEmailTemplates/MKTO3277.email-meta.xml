    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},

Greetings from Turbonomic!

If you’re like me, as we approach the Thanksgiving season (which comes earlier in Canada for me and my fellow Canadians), most of us begin our process of reflecting, being thankful, and appreciating all the goodness life has to offer. I want to take a moment to express my personal, and Turbonomic’s, gratitude and appreciation for your continued interest, engagement, and support of the Turbonomic Blogging Program.

With the close of 2017 now on the horizon, we are taking a closer look at our Blogging Program. What is working well? How can we improve? What can we do better? We want your input and candid feedback on how we can better serve, provide access to and engage with you better. Send us your thoughts on the quality and depth of content you receive from us, your interactions (or desire for more engagement) with Turbonomic leaders and experts, and any new opportunities you would like to engage with us!

We have a few of our own ideas. For starters…


	- We are introducing a new hands-on program around containerization and looking for a select number of volunteers to participate. This is going to be fun, a great learning experience, and the best part is being able to share this with you and our community. If you are interested in participating, please respond to this email and let me know – and include your current level of knowledge with container technology and container orchestration. We need folks of every knowledge level! 

	- We are updating Turbonomic banner ads across the Web to promote our whitepaper, The Path to Hybrid Cloud &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/hybrid-cloud-intelligent-bursting-aws-microsoft-azure/]]&gt;. If you need a new banner and link please respond to this email and we’ll follow up with next steps!




I’m also happy to share that Turbonomic would like to renew a sponsorship with you. We have exciting things coming and we will continue to provide more frequent updates as we refine the program. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me with any questions. Alternatively, Patrick (patrick.walsh@turbonomic.com) and Katryn (katryn.mcgaughey@turbonomic.com) are also here to support.

Thank you again for being part of our community – and we look forward to continuing to work with you.
