    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

 I have been following the growth and customer demands of BB&amp;T over the past year. With such growth, comes the need for a resilient and hybrid performing data center. Turbonomic has helped customers meet these demand challenges, customers including JP Morgan Chase, Barclays, and PNC. 
This summer, Turbonomic’s executive chairman Bill Veghte (former COO of HP), CTO Charles Crouchman (formerly Head of Development/Ops at Cirba) and CEO Ben Nye (Bain Capital Ventures, Solarwinds, VERITAS and Precise) will be at the following events, eager to hear and share stories regarding hybrid IT. 
 
	-  HPE Discover (June 5-8)
 
	-  Cisco Live! (June 25-29)
 
	-  VMworld US (August 27-31)
 
	-  Microsoft Ignite (September 25-29)
 
	-  AWS re:Invent (November 27 – December 1)
 	-  Gartner Data Center Infrastructure &amp; Operations (December 4-7) 
 Happy to facilitate a conversation with one of our executives if you’re planning on attending any of these events. You may also request to meet with them here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/leadership-meetings?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=sb-exec-meeting&amp;utm_content=1]]&gt;.   Thanks, {{lead.Lead Owner First Name:default=Turbonomic}} {{lead.Lead Owner Last Name:default=Team}}</textOnly>
