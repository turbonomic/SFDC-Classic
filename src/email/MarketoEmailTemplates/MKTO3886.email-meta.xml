Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Using Turbonomic, Node4 was able to improve performance for over 5,000 virtual workloads by more than 20% and sustainably scale company growth of 60-70%.

 &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/safely-increase-infrastructure-utilization/node4-success-story]]&gt;

&quot;We used to just throw money at hardware to fix our issues. With Turbonomic, we saw that we were not saturated and could in fact consolidate our workloads dramatically - freeing us 17blades.&quot; - Gregg Mearing, Head of Managed Services, Node4





More than 1,900 organizations leverage Turbonomic to optimize for performance, cost, and compliance in real-time. See who’s on board by industry &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/customers/customers-by-industry/]]&gt;. 






Regards,

Team Turbonomic</textOnly>
