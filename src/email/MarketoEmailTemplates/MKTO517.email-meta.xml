Activate Virtual Health Monitor &amp;
Map Your Environment.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
Heyo! Look at you go. You just downloaded a free and unlimited instance of the VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor (VHM).
You&apos;re on your way to what we at VMTurbo call “environment enlightenment”. Within minutes, you’ll have mountaintop visibility into your virtual environment, and wield the power (use it wisely) to identify problems in real time. Performance reports? All yours. In perpetuity. Forever.

Once you&apos;ve deployed VHM, the initial credentials are administrator for username and password. The setup wizard will handle the rest.
Ready for the big leagues? Download a full-featured 30-day trial of VMTurbo Operations Manager &lt;http://bit.ly/1k61Zyy&gt;, the world’s most advanced virtualization management platform.

Looking forward to your success,
VMTurbo
