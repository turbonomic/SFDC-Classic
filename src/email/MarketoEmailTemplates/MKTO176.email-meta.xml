Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Just a quick note to follow up on the email we sent you last week. We look forward to showing you how you can maximize value from Operations Manager and maintain active control over your IT operations.

Join us for a short phone conversation &lt;http://bit.ly/13tZgb2&gt; to learn how you can apply our economic scheduling engine with prescriptive analytics to maintain active control of your IT environment. 

Want more information first? Browse this page &lt;http://bit.ly/16VXpL0&gt; (it’ll only take a few minutes) and see for yourself how our approach to automate control of your virtualized environment is being used by hundreds of other organizations like BT, CSC, Coca-Cola, VeriSign, and Indiana University. With Operations Manager, these customers are able to drive down costs, improve virtual workload performance and maximize resource utilization.

Thank you,
