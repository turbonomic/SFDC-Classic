Dear {{Lead.First Name}},

Do your eyes glaze over when you hear “Desired State”? Has your brain logged it as some buzzword that should be ignored? We understand, but seriously, it’s real.
The Desired State matters and it’s not easy to achieve. Sure, “assuring application performance, while maximizing efficiency” sounds simple enough, but it’s the data center’s n-dimensional challenge that can only be solved in software. Oh, did we lose you at “n-dimensional”?
It’s okay, just read the e-book.
