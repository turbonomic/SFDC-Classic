Thank You.
Thanks for giving us a shot. Your trial has come and gone, but we&apos;d like to invite you to download our free and unlimited VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor &lt;http://bit.ly/1ck6OMP&gt;. 

VHM won&apos;t continually drive your environment to health like Operations Manager, but it will let you know when things go awry - and we won&apos;t charge you a cent for it.

Get Free VHM &lt;http://bit.ly/1ck6OMP&gt;

If you&apos;d like to revisit licensing VMTurbo Operations Manager, we are always here &lt;mailto: sales@vmturbo.com&gt;.

In good health,
 VMTurbo
