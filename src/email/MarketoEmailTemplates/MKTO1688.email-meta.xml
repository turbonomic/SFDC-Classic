Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

For most organizations, business success is a direct function of IT success.
In the past traditional IT architectures have been based on silos with computing resources dedicated to specific applications, as well as over-provisioning to accommodate peak demands and potential future growth.
Virtualized systems have since replaced these silos with a layer of shared resources. However, virtualization also brings a new set of challenges for the data center. Virtual and cloud environments are dynamic and become infinitely more complex as they scale.

 - Virtualizationâ€™s transformative impact on the data center and the challenges it creates.
 - A new approach to data center management: the economic abstraction of virtual and cloud environments, which enables software to address both the complexity and scale that today challenges application performance.
