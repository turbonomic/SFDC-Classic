    <subject>Last Chance - You&apos;re Invited: Nike Shopping Spree and Executive Networking Lunch</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Please join me for an exclusive invite only executive networking lunch I am hosting on Friday September 29th at Maggiano&apos;s in the Grove &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-los-angeles/]]&gt; to discuss the benefits and challenges of adopting a Hybrid Cloud Strategy.

In my more than 25 years at Microsoft, HPE and now Turbonomic, I have had the privilege of watching IT go through waves of disruption from a birds-eye view. All previous waves pale in comparison to that which we observe today. 

Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reinvent their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging and mistakes are costly. We will discuss this unprecedented shift our industry currently faces and how we as the stewards of our generation can lead the innovation charge. It is my goal and hope that this networking opportunity will be intellectually stimulating and beneficial for all.

I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. After our lunch concludes we will take all attendees to the Nike store for a $150 shopping spree. As space is limited, I do ask that you please register here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/learn-los-angeles/]]&gt; as soon as possible.

Yours Sincerely,

Bill Veghte

Bill Veghte
