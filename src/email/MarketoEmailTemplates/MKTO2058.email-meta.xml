Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Are you running Microsoft Exchange? Did you know that the mail server will experience performance degradation when it’s over-provisioned, as well as under-provisioned?
Stop the sizing guessing games. If you want to assure performance in your Microsoft Exchange deployment, you’ll need to look at the problem in a different light.
To learn why this matters and what this means for you, download the e-Book below.
You Will Learn


	- Why the design of Microsoft Exchange specifically requires that it run on virtualized infrastructure that is in a Desired State
	- How traditional approaches to virtualization and cloud management exacerbate performance issues for Microsoft Exchange
	- How economic abstractions of the data center achieve and maintain a Desired State in virtual and cloud environments
