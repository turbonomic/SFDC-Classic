Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

With its 
promise of speed and elasticity, Kubernetes has taken the lead among container platforms. Unfortunately, its benefits come with a steep learning curve that can prolong the adoption process. It doesn’t have to be that way for you and your team.

 &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/thx-wbn-using-ai-to-optimize-kubernetes-clusters/]]&gt; 

Turbonomic’s AI-powered decision engine now continuously optimizes Kubernetes environments – enabling elastic infrastructure and assuring performance, uniting DevOps and infrastructure with full stack control. 

Schedule a Demo &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/request-a-demo/]]&gt; and learn how Turbonomic can help your IT organization optimize for performance, compliance, and cost in real-time.
