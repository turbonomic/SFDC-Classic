    <subject>How MetroStar Continuously Optimizes Their AWS Environment with Turbonomic</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/accelerate-cloud-migration-projects/metrostar-success-story]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
Using Turbonomic, MetroStar Systems rapidly improved 
their environment in the background and simultaneously reduced their monthly AWS spend by 25%. Additionally, when the team needed to quickly analyze potential migrations, Turbonomic removed time, uncertainty, and risk out of the equation.

&quot;It saves us thousands of dollars in the cloud every month and saves us hundreds of hours of labor a year across our entire estate.&quot; - John Belcher, Principal Infrastructure Engineer, MetroStar Systems




When you&apos;re ready, we&apos;d love to show you how Turbonomic can identify performance risks before your customers do and save you at least 30% off your cloud bill.


Regards,
Megan


P.S. In the meantime, I hope you&apos;ll enjoy a coffee on us. Keep an eye out! </textOnly>
