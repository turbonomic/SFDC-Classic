Hey {{Lead.First Name}},
Over the past 6-months the Green Circle community has been an amazing resource for VMT pros and beginners alike (If you haven&apos;t registered make sure you do so here &lt;https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/welcome&gt;).
Now its time to step it up a bit though, which is why we&apos;re taking it live! Thats right, join Trevor Roberts Jr., Craig Tracey, and Eric Wright in a live round table discussion on Tuesday April 20th &lt;https://plus.google.com/events/cpbr6tamqmf9f40f21q3pchl5sk&gt;  as they discuss all things OpenStack. This will include the activity heading into the Kilo release, and the upcoming OpenStack Summit in Vancouver.
This is your chance to get involved and ask the experts any questions you may have surrounding OpenStack in a live discussion, so don&apos;t miss out!
