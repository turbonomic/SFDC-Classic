VDI Promotion


VDI places significant demands on the underlying compute, storage and network infrastructure. Assuring end-users receive an experience equivalent to that of a physical desktop is a challenge. Turbonomic manages the significant resource demands and fluctuations which often stall VDI deployments by continuously assuring Virtual Desktops get the resources they need, when they need them. 

Until January 31st, 2017, partners who bring Turbonomic to a customer with a VDI environment will receive an additional 10% discount on their Turbonomic list price. Simply register your opportunity in the Turbonomic Partner Portal to receive this offer. PLUS! Partners will receive an additional 10% off their transfer price on any subsequent deal that closes within 90 days of the VDI deal.

Turbonomic Certification 
Opportunity

Do you want more expertise in the Turbonomic technology and the ability to leverage Turbonomic to its fullest potential? Turbonomic&apos;s ACE training program signifies the mastery of Turbonomic technology and its autonomic control system actions, including knowledge of all dashboards, administration, ,plan function, and reservations and deployment. To be certified, individuals must complete a two-day course and pass multiple-choice and practical exams. 

Those who are ACE certified join a growing community of thought leaders in virtualization and cloud management. They earn 500 points in the Green Circle Community and are eligible to pursue further levels of certification. These levels include Turbonomic ACE Professional, an under-the-covers examination of the Turbonomic platform. Turbonomic has recently announced its new ACE Master Certification which will focus even more deeply into emerging technologies. 

Turbonomic is offering courses in New York in January and February of 2017. For more details on how to register, you can find the ACE registration page here &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/training-and-services/certification/]]&gt;.
