<span style="font-size: 12px;">Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},<br /><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #262626;">Having spent 20 years at Microsoft, followed by my role as COO of Hewlett-Packard, I have had the privilege of watching IT go through waves of transformation from a birds-eye view. All previous waves pale in comparison to that which we observe&nbsp;today.<br /><br /></span>

<span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #262626;">Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to adopt a hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging â€“ mistakes are costly. This is exacerbated once customers get to the cloud and need to manage complexities across cloud and on-premises simultaneously.<br /><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #262626;">I cordially invite you to join myself&nbsp;and a dozen of your fellow IT leaders in Indianapolis&nbsp;on July&nbsp;13<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>at The Capital Grille&nbsp;for an <a href="https://turbonomic.com/learn-indianapolis" target="_blank">Executive Networking Lunch</a> from 12:00 p.m. until 2:00 p.m. We will discuss this unprecedented shift our industry currently faces and how we as the stewards of our generation&nbsp;can lead the innovation charge. It is my goal and&nbsp;hope that this networking opportunity will be intellectually stimulating and beneficial for all.<br /><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #262626;">I look forward to meeting you, and participating in an engaging conversation. As space is limited, I do ask that you please <a href="https://turbonomic.com/learn-indianapolis" target="_blank">register here</a>&nbsp;as soon as possible.<br /></span>
