<span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">We recently launched our <a href="http://info.turbonomic.com/m000Zg10g0cg9gZyIe00ZH0" target="_blank"><strong><em>Infrastructure Optimization Survey</em></strong></a>, and are offering a $25 Amazon gift card for completing the 5 minute survey by April 1st. We are also offering $100 Amazon gift card for agreeing to a 30 minute meeting with a Turbonomic engineer (meeting must complete by April 15th). If at the end of the meeting, you choose to engage in a proof of value, we will donate $1,000 to the 501(c)(3) charity of your choosing.</span>
