    <subject>Are you under pressure to transform your IT organization?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Many IT organizations strive to optimize performance but struggle to make progress given the many challenges they tackle on a daily basis. Do you grapple with shifting priorities and a seemingly endless backlog of work? We&apos;ve created a new Learning Center to help.

We&apos;ve taken our best educational content and organized it by use-case, making it easier for you to identify new ways to approach the challenges you face and to see where we can support you.

Here are some of the areas in the Learning Center to explore:


	- Accelerate your Cloud Migration &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/accelerate-cloud-migration-projects]]&gt;
	- Accelerate your Consolidation and Refresh Projects &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/accelerate-consolidation-refresh-projects]]&gt;
	- Improve your IT Staff&apos;s Productivity &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/improve-it-staff-productivity]]&gt;
	- Optimize your Public Cloud Spend &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/optimize-public-cloud-spend]]&gt;
	- Safely Increase your Infrastructure Utilization &lt;[[https://resources.turbonomic.com/safely-increase-infrastructure-utilization]]&gt;



We hope you find it helpful!
