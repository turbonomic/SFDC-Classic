I was hoping that the team and I could get the chance to show you why both NetApp and Cisco are technical partners to Turbonomic and use our autonomic platform in their internal infrastructures for even greater performance.  In short, Turbonomic dynamically and automatically adjusts configuration, resource allocation and workload placement across compute and storage to meet performance demands while utilizing the infrastructure as efficiently as possible, allowing you to:
	- Reduce ongoing compute/storage costs by 20-30% by optimizing workload placement	- Reduce operational costs of problem and incident management by eliminating complex problems with disk space and IO performance contention	- Assure application performance and reduce risk by minimizing the contention for CPU, Mem, disk space and IO capacity	- Enable more IO-intensive applications to be virtualized reliably, bringing down the overall cost to deliver compute services to the business and customers
Turbonomic and NetApp Storage Efficiency Systems &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/company/technology-partners/netapp-storage/]]&gt; I know you are very busy but do you have 30 minutes over the next few weeks for a quick initial discussion/demonstration of how this is possible? I’d love to get the chance to show you how we can help and am confident you will find it valuable. Best, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  </textOnly>
