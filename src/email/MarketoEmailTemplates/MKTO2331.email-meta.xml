I was hoping to discuss with you how our platform Turbonomic enables teams to capitalize on the investment they made in virtualization and storage providers, giving them a way of continue to grow and scale without having to buy more hardware.  In short, Turbonomic dynamically and automatically adjusts configuration, resource allocation and workload placement across compute and storage to meet performance demands while utilizing the infrastructure as efficiently as possible, allowing you to:
	- Reduce ongoing compute/storage costs by 20-30% by optimizing workload placement	- Reduce operational costs of problem and incident management by eliminating complex problems with disk space and IO performance contention	- Assure application performance and reduce risk by minimizing the contention for CPU, Mem, disk space and IO capacity	- Enable more IO-intensive applications to be virtualized reliably, bringing down the overall cost to deliver compute services to the business and customers

Do you have any time available over the next couple of weeks?  Best regards,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  Going to Cisco Live?
