Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Join us this Thursday April 24th at 1:30 PM EST &lt;http://vmturbo.com/resources/webinar-deploying-automating-mission-critical-virtual-desktops-at-atg-freight-llc?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=atg-webinar&amp;utm_content=04212015&gt; as we find out how American Transport Group deployed and automated their VDI-based mobile workforce, don&apos;t miss out!

We will learn:


 - How ATG handled an annual workload growth rate of 30% with a combination of EMC Clariion disk and Pure Storage flash arrays.
 - Why guaranteeing reliable service was so challenging in such an environment.
 - How they dealt with performance troubleshooting.
 - What they ultimately did to move from pinpointing and troubleshooting to a more preventative approach that assures service levels are met.
