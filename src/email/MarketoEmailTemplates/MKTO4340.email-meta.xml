    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I’m planning to be in Indianapolis on December 6th, and will be hosting a dinner for local IT leaders. I would love if you could join me.

Not only will we treat you to a delicious meal at Vida, but you’ll have the chance to network with your peers on topics such as:


	- Accelerating your public cloud migration projects
	- Continuously optimizing your IT infrastructure
	- And much more



Will you join me? Seats are filling up fast, click here to reserve your spot at dinner &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/vip-indy/]]&gt;.

Best,
 Steve
