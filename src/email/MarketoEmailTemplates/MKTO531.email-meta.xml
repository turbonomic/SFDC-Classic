Discover &lt;http://bit.ly/1jdmh6k&gt;.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

DISCOVER &lt;http://bit.ly/1jdmh6k&gt; is the first step in VMTurbo&apos;s four-pronged approach to perpetual virtual health. Within 15 minutes of deployment, VMTurbo looks under the hood of your IT stack and gives it to you straight:

&quot;Things are pretty terrible in there,&quot; or maybe just, &quot;Things could be managed a lot more efficiently.&quot; VMTurbo generates a fully itemized list of risk items, as well as areas to immediately improve efficiency. Are your VMs rightsized? Do they reside on the optimal host? Have you maximized potential VM density across your environment? Think of it as our State of Your Environment Address.

 Our Discover video &lt;http://bit.ly/1jdmh6k&gt; in the Evaluation Resource Center (remember, you bookmarked it?) walks you through the look under the hood to ensure you&apos;re getting the most out of your VMTurbo trial.
