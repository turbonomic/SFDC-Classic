Every Friday in June, we gave away two full conference passes to VMworld® U.S. You didn’t think we’d stop there, did you?

Our VMworld Europe Sweepstakes is a continuation of tradition: getting as many people to VMworld as we can. We’re leading the virtual revolution from the spindles of your on-prem datastores to the beefiest VM you’ve provisioned in the Amazon cloud. Why should we limit the boundaries of our virtual love?
Enter today. &lt;http://vmturbo.com/vmturbo-vmworld-europe-sweepstakes?utm_source=vmturbo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=EUsweeps&gt; Return for winner listings every Friday: August 22, 29, &amp; September 5.
See you in Barca.
