I’ve copied a brief rundown below but let me know if this is something you would be interested in reviewing further. Autonomic Platform for AWS &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE1Xc8TKI1xQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhXDU66Sxv%2DgbPKIYJcdvJm1cU8r%2D6gwHQXq4CvpmmcD2cgWUg%2DaA2tXZZyqSfjaJIUeROF3XfKBbMWyQUFrO8pzJH4UYeW8l2U9lDoyxCXGlgtsPuvz0uQOLBwtuAztHh2xlwJScWkziyX25IvhHU90tZuj04%5Fr%5F1%5FBt1S2D6cWnbv97aqFrxfaofjk%2D%5FYqv8kNgo2vKg7QjyIPV2bIduhdC0oxBi5wBwdIS1sLxFOIMocghPXkypZJMUeRHLgnxBx3Hkl4ple576tuga5UmjpMRKvmCez2wqtD9ED9S2HsvgGtC7waBfXx91zUxf1U6uZ6gg%2C/jU1QdsHNLFlNoVdlsbPWN7vhmzDGf5a7vvJtG%5Fjp1N8x0EZqPO%5FANQ752pxEDp5tcLSWFRYAAN0y4TNnDvWHfo9O9fhUCA%2DxVzbAl7GXPalNfrpn2c91wL211G8Ers69pkneC0AAT3xlZ0vPTbkvlnC1FLEUbE7V3l%5FAIYZuzgw7jbgBwty7ebXy%2Dn6wrkCbyCKjEnB6osCW%2Dge%5FUaw6vIc5lWAJ4HUtQtimxBTg2J8J%5Fhd99OFn1g4y8d9fbcxA8RywXz3U95byHd9%2DSISiia%5FqqKUfSREBuI8cXkaCOEGdMJq%2DemRw%5FAPXm2g9IwE3FiVwA%5FUrxwTIn3VReMAZFRmQyzwhx0ssgIBd%2DaPKvyCEJXryaDGm5xGm21SzdNIP8HGozd1zxBrVIjbm9uBMAHGgCaSMhEKbYIXukBAhQ8VbbJAeI7CI7v37xdks%5FCCJcE2f0M%2DFERdxYb02hfinks%2D9ntCBp1%5FmuBp%5F1wF4Mjty7hXib5%2D%5FPAB39rO8oJXvqJOa9nQQ%5FFpOIxYHtg3ka90R1wn0]]&gt; Best, James  From: Timothy Poulos [mailto:Timothy.Poulos@tampagov.net]

Subject: RE: Turbonomic Material for Review  Hi James, Eric forwarded me the information you sent him. I believe Turbonomic used to be called VM Turbo.  We ran a 30 day trial of this product in our environment a year ago or so.  It is a very good product, but we’ve got a lot of tools in place, and didn’t feel it would be worth it for us to deploy it. Thanks for forwarding us this information! Tim PoulosNetwork Supervisor                    From: James Wilcox [mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;]

Subject: RE: Turbonomic Material for Review  Hi Eric, Hope you had a great weekend. I just wanted to follow up with you to see if you have had a chance to take a look at the material and what your thoughts were if so.  Do you have fifteen minutes to walk through the material with me and discuss how Turbonomic’s different approach to optimizing you’re infrastructure can help with cost savings within City of Tampa’s infrastructure? I promise it will be worth your time.  Thanks!  James From: James Wilcox

Subject: Turbonomic Material for Review  Hi Eric, Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. As discussed, I’ve included some material that digs deeper into Turbonomic and the benefits our customers see.  Somewhat recently, the team at City of Miami implemented Turbonomic into their infrastructure and were able to consolidate their physical and virtual environment because Turbonomic used intelligent automation to properly size and place each workload within their environment. This saved them a lot of money on licensing and hardware spend.  City of Garland Saves with Turbonomic &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__turbonomic.com_wp-2Dcontent_uploads_Turbonomic-2DCityGarland-2DSuccess-2DStory.pdf&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=XqATCztIzLCYon5OykG81w&amp;r=RXsTXMj4-AHebXOOc4gPI911r9d2tYhddCRZXQqQtBU&amp;m=L5lcUhwfijSXCmVKizOnPS7pHQRDDt20sok0D99s4hs&amp;s=7r60HQdg-QazVknImRMyc4eEMPVl_BiL59FYp-fCuPg&amp;e=]]&gt;Turbonomic ROI &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__turbonomic.com_wp-2Dcontent_uploads_Turbonomic-5FROI.pdf&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=XqATCztIzLCYon5OykG81w&amp;r=RXsTXMj4-AHebXOOc4gPI911r9d2tYhddCRZXQqQtBU&amp;m=L5lcUhwfijSXCmVKizOnPS7pHQRDDt20sok0D99s4hs&amp;s=37Pk48TkoyTqH5ZtsA1gSF6zaHQbCftpx2AEbprebbE&amp;e=]]&gt;  Also, below is the 30 day free trial as well just in case you decide you’d like to take a look at the technology.
