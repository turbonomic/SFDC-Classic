Not only that - the performance went through the roof.” See more in the video below.  Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; The promotion for $15,000 off Turbo offer still stands.

Subject: $15,000 off Turbonomic for Collier County Public Schools Hi Cedar, I’m reaching out with a special offer for State and Local organizations as we approach the summer months. We’ve worked with a number of cities/counties including City of Miami, and Orange County (to name local Florida customers) to alleviate their IT management challenges.  I typically find that customers in the state and local government industry see the most value in Turbonomic’s ability to:
	- Reduce ongoing compute/storage costs by 20-30% by optimizing workload placement	- Reduce operational costs of problem and incident management by eliminating complex problems with disk space and IO performance contention	- Assure application performance and reduce risk by minimizing the contention for CPU, Mem, disk space and IO capacity	- Enable more IO-intensive applications to be virtualized reliably, bringing down the overall cost to deliver compute services to the business and customers
 Turbonomic directly addresses both of these challenges through our intelligent automation, enabling teams to increase the infrastructure’s capacity and the performance of the applications they run (see more in link in signature). With that in mind, we’d like to offer a $15,000 discount for any deal with us, if you install Turbonomic’s autonomic performance platform before the end of May. Do you have time in the coming month or so for a quick discussion around the benefits that you and the team at Collier County Public Schools could see after installing Turbonomic into your environment? Best,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jE9QdMfNIlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhWGUCnSzj6oKLVY4FHdKZg38lu8KS2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYeG8F2tx0j8ywSZGGVEt%5FiBw0iSKJVmtPRQtnsA4wUKScml2gHLyoYBiD8W78kitxU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DI8sLwzyhnGx3VMkYfC2Nnx8L8nYY2PFM3NupoRaISnXobAn5kELy2A2HJY0By1a2mYwW8C7%5FOgTb19lqU2KtBN%5F5gkSxYcnbuWkZE6EPG4Y%2C/j0lZdsHILFlNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwt0x3V19ZqOQNUr7t8deF89gfdy%5FKjgaMJNE7jVXPNLEK5RZ%2D9lcM0m%2DUh%5FMgZvPaJliX6xUzs9trKuP7XMcg%2Dilu13APEhLE1UpNyLeZbA3gS%2DqOZ4lTQKU7mnUNpM2ji1FhrIXwoE%2C]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[http://mkto-sjp0104.com/ol/jE9QdMfNIlxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhWGUCnSzj6oKLVY4FHdKZg38lu8KS2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYeG8F2tx0j8ywSZGGVEt%5FiBw0iSKJVmtPRQtnsA4wUKScml2gHLyoYBiD8W78kitxU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DI8sLwzyhnGx3VMkYfC2Nnx8L8nYY2PFM3NupoRaISnXobAn5kELy2A2HJY0By1a2mYwW8C7%5FOgTb19lqU2KtBN%5F5gkSxYcnbuWkZE6EPG4Y%2C/h01TcMPMdlBQuVN5sfaYL6z%2D0SLJdpuno5xpHOXk3cEx1EF9PO%5FANR7ig8duCJ05OLuGNCM7KZpCwyl2I%2D%2DzTtEX7uxcJ0CKUDf1pJLbVZhJZZhdxOZz8aT220owucSrp3vlCEM7RzQ%5FQEPOTQ%2C%2C]]&gt;  Going to Cisco Live?
