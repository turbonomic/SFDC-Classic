Hi Susan,
Thank you for completing the Turbonomic IT Maturity Survey! You should receive your Amazon Gift Card shortly.
I can offer you another $100 Amazon Gift Card or a $100 donation to a charity of your choice if I can schedule 30 minutes between you and a Turbonomic Engineer. You indicated on your survey several challenges for you and the team at Montgomery County Public Schools that Turbonomic directly addresses, specifically:
	- Troubleshooting/Proactive Monitoring - Turbonomic has been proven to decrease performance alerts by 80% or more through its patented automation engine	- Administrative Costs (High Admin:Workload Ratio) - Turbonomic has been proven to empower organizations to manage 10x more workloads with the same headcount through its intelligent automation	- Growth in Environment Complexity - Turbonomic’s vendor-agnostic, patented analytics have been proven to reduce infrastructure requirements by 30% or more through intelligent
 Turbonomic can also allow teams to spin up virtual machines quickly because it answers the following questions that usually fall on the shoulders of engineers/administrators: ·         Are the virtual machines properly sized and placed within the infrastructure so we know the applications are getting the right resources they need in order to run optimally? ·         Do we have enough capacity within our existing infrastructure to onboard X numbers of virtual machines? ·         Are the virtual machines onboard and sized properly? And how will they affect every layer of the stack from storage to the applications?
Do you have some time for my team and I to provide a 30 minute introduction on how Turbonomic addresses these challenges? I am confident you will find it valuable.
