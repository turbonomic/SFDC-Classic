    <subject>Make us Prove It: Try VMTurbo Free and Solve for Underutilized Infrastructure</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Control your virtual environment and see fast results. According to a recent survey &lt;http://bit.ly/1aZGecW&gt; of VMTurbo customers, 89% saw the value of automated control within their virtualized environments within 3 months, and an explosive 80% increased resource utilization by 20% or more. 

Try before you buy is a motto we embrace. You don’t have to purchase VMTurbo today to see its value in your own environment.  Download this free trial &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; and see first-hand how quickly and easily you can gain control of your virtual IT and see why so many of our users have reported significant CapEx and OpEx reductions over a short time.

Kind Regards

The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
