VMTurbo is pleased to announce Early Access for v5.1 scheduled for a February 2015 release
Are you someone who likes to test the LATEST technology and provide FEEDBACK?  Are you running:


 - OpenStack™?
 - Java Applications running on WebSphere®, WebLogic or JBOSS™ platforms?
 - HP 3PAR or Pure Storage Platforms?


Then the VMTurbo Early Access Program wants YOU!  VMTurbo is pleased to announce Early Access availability of version 5.1 introducing improved Demand Control with the Application Control Module, Continuous Projections &amp; Reservation enhancements, and new platform support on Storage Control Module with HP 3PAR and Pure Storage starting DECEMBER 29, 2014 for Storage Platform testing, and JANUARY 9, 2015 for all features.  
Key New Features for you to evaluate:
Application Mediation
In this release we provide simplified, ease of configuration for mediation for WebLogic and JBoss Application Servers (WebSphere was available in 5.0).  Are you running Java Applications? Send me an email to get started!
 
Application Control - The Next Generation
Better management at the pinnacle of the Demand &amp; Supply Chain - control your application servers by defining the best placement and configuration, and driving actions to resize heap, thread pools, and determine when to create another instance of your application.
 
Continuous Projections &amp; Reservations Enhancements
Answer the question of what does the Desired State look like for my environment when projected into the future, and when introducing changes in Demand over different periods of time.  Simulate the future based on Reservations and future Demand and Supply changes.
 
New User Experience
Answer the question &quot;What is the Desired State for my Demand?&quot; with a more customizable Workload Chart!
 
Storage Control
VMTurbo continues to expand Storage Platform coverage with HP 3PAR and Pure Storage support.
