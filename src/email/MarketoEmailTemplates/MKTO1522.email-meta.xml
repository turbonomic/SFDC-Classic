Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) holds great promise for end-user computing teams to centralize management and maintenance, lower operational costs, improve security, and deliver flexibility to mobile workers.

The paper below explores some of the common challenges facing VDI planning, deployment and operations and how to avoid these costly challenges.
