    <textOnly>Hi David 
The complexity of managing hybrid cloud is beyond human scale. Enterprises around the globe are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, and the adoption of cloud is central to this transformation. 
Determining which workloads should remain on-premises, which should migrate to the cloud and how to manage this transition is challenging. The exponential complexity and scale hybrid cloud creates is beyond human scale to monitor, analyze and proactively act upon. 
Gartner estimates that by 2020, 25% of large enterprises will implement dynamic optimization technology to manage public cloud costs and risks – up from less than 1% in 2016. This projection is rooted in the fact that hybrid cloud management cannot be effectively done by humans. 
I am excited to introduce you to Turbonomic 5.9, the world’s most advanced Hybrid Cloud Management Platform.
