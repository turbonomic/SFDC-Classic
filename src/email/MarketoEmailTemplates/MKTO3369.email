<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">With less than two days until the game I wanted to see if you would join us to celebrate the<strong><span style="color: #339966;">&nbsp;Holiday Season</span>&nbsp;</strong>at our<strong><span style="color: #339966;">&nbsp;VIP executive event</span></strong> with Cisco Thursday night, (12/14) in a luxury suite at the Warriors game. Bill Veghte, our Executive Chairman (ex-EVP/GM Microsoft and HP) will be hosting the event.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Bill helped build Azure for Microsoft and is currently our Executive Chairman and is personally helping to lead our engineering relationship with both AWS and Microsoft. We have 1800+ customers including HP, Cisco, Conoco Phillips, Citi, JPMC, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, BMC and many more worldwide. Bill will lead a brief executive forum on todayâ€™s hybrid cloud challenges (how management risks are formidable and oversights are expensive). After which we will watch the Warriors take on the Mavericks.</span></p>
