Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Congratulations! You’ve successfully downloaded the VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor software.

To activate the solution, you need to take these steps:

 1) First, install the appliance. If you need assistance with installation, you can refer to the installation guide &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/resources/documentation/&gt;. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Our documentation is in revision and will refer to “Community Edition,” the predecessor to Virtual Health Monitor.

 2) Next, the setup wizard will step you through the process of requesting and installing the license key to activate Virtual Health Monitor for the term of your license. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: The installation and configuration wizard presents you with three options for License Installation: 
- “I have a license for Full Product” 
- “Request a license for a 30-day Trial” 
- “Request a license for the free Community Edition” 
Select “Community Edition,” the predecessor to Virtual Health Monitor.
 
3) And then the setup wizard will guide you through setting up the target configuration.

After, you should be all set to begin exploring VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor and seeing the value its monitoring and reporting provide for your virtual environment.
