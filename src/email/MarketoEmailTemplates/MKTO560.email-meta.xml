    <subject>Season&apos;s Greetings from your friends at VMTurbo</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}

Innovation in our industry challenges each of us to stay current while doing our day jobs. In talking with you, 2013 was no exception.

 - This might actually have been the year of the VDI, with software and hardware innovations that solve boot storms and alleviate IOPS bottlenecks.
 - The private cloud became less...how should I say it, nebulous, with the OpenStack specification and Citrix&apos;s open source CloudStack.
 - Software defined data center took center stage, at least in pundits&apos; minds, with different solutions that define, through code, the structure of the storage, the network, and the compute layers. 

Driven by innovation, VMTurbo doubled revenues and doubled the number of customers. JPMorgan inducted us into their Hall of Innovation for technology infrastructure, and we’re proud to join companies like FireEye, Palantir, and Tableau on this list. An independent survey found that our customers realize an ROI within 90 days, and the majority of our customers use us for automation. If you aren’t achieving the ROI you expected, or aren’t automating, we’d love to show you how – there’s no added cost.

In the new year, we will debut our biggest innovations yet. We’re extending our groundbreaking approach to the rest of the datacenter. We will add and enhance control modules for NetApp, EMC, and Cisco UCS that will allow you to manage and control your fabric and storage in the same way VMTurbo allows you to manage compute: light touch. At the same time, we’re working with customers to eliminate artificial cluster boundaries and distribute loads across all hosts in your environment – allowing for even greater utilization and densities while assuring VM performance. VMTurbo will allow you to control your software-defined datacenter. (Let me know if you want a sneak peek) I think 2014 will be just as amazing.

I hope that everyone enjoys a couple of restful days over the next few weeks with your families.
