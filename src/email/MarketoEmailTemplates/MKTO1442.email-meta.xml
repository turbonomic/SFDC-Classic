    <subject>Why App Owners &amp; Infrastructure Managers Should Be Friends</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

App Owners and Infrastructure Managers have similar goals: assuring business agility and zero downtime, all at a low cost. Yet, traditionally there’s been a rift between them as they tend to speak different languages. Application owners speak in terms of end user satisfaction. Infrastructure managers speak in terms of consolidation ratios, network latency, and utilization rates.

This whitepaper explores the organizational challenges that divide application owners and infrastructure managers, as well as each player’s point of view. The reality is that these opposing forces can be the best of friends. In fact, they should be if IT is to play a critical role in a business’s success.
