Control &lt;http://bit.ly/1mf8ttg&gt;.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
CONTROL &lt;http://bit.ly/1mf8ttg&gt; is the third step in VMTurbo&apos;s four-pronged approach to perpetual virtual health.

Traditional virtual ops managers are threshold-based (vCPU, vMem, IOPS) and send alerts when the thresholds are breached. By then, it&apos;s too late. The house is on fire.

Wouldn&apos;t it be nice if the fire department arrived beforehand and unplugged your toaster? That&apos;s us. The soothsaying fire department. VMTurbo controls your infrastructure even across heterogeneous hypervisors, hardware vendors, and cloud environments.

 Our Control video &lt;http://bit.ly/1mf8ttg&gt; in the Evaluation Resource Center walks you through maintaining your converged environment in the Optimal Operating Zone (OOZ), to ensure you&apos;re getting the most out of your VMTurbo trial.

Questions, comments, or feedback? Contact us &lt;sales@vmturbo.com&gt;.
Unplugging your toaster,
