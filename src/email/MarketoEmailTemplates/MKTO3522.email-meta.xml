    <subject>[Live Webinar] 3 Ways to Accelerate and De-Risk Your Cloud Migration</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cloud-migration-webinar/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_migration_webinar]]&gt;
Hi {{Lead.First Name}},


Cloud migrations continue to be a pressing problem for many organizations – first with planning, and prioritizing the migration, then with optimizing the environment beyond Day 2

But there’s one more critical step – once you make it to the cloud, you have to deal with the unexpected consequences.


Our customers have repeatedly told us that common industry tools and approaches for planning today are little more than a series of guesses, and that these inadequate plans result in a shocking level of effort needed to manually fight performance fires and try to control ballooning costs. What if there was a better approach?


Please join our live webinar on Thursday March 22nd at 1PM ET &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/cloud-migration-webinar/?utm_source=turbonomic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_migration_webinar]]&gt;  to learn how Turbonomic customers today are radically accelerating AND de-risking their cloud migrations – and then driving continuous optimization from there.
