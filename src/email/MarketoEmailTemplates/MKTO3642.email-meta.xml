Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 
We’d like to cordially invite you to an exclusive networking event in Washington, D.C. on May 15th at Casa Luca &lt;[[https://bit.ly/vip-dc2]]&gt;. 



Enterprises are facing incredible pressure to modernize and transform their IT to become a digital business, leading many organizations to reimagine their hybrid cloud strategy. Determining which workloads go on-premises, which go in the cloud, and how to manage the transition is challenging – and mistakes are costly.
 
Washington, D.C. IT Networking Dinner &lt;[[https://bit.ly/vip-dc2/]]&gt;
Casa Luca &lt;[[https://bit.ly/vip-dc2/]]&gt;
Tuesday, May 15th | 6:00 p.m. &lt;[[https://bit.ly/vip-dc2/]]&gt;




Throughout the evening, you’ll have the chance to share knowledge on tackling these challenges and learn how organizations like yours are adopting workload automation at the scale of the hybrid cloud.


We hope you will join us for this discussion by registering here &lt;[[https://bit.ly/vip-dc2]]&gt;.
