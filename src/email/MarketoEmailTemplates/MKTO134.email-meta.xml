Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},
It was great to meet and spend some time with you at Cloud Expo Europe 29th-30th January – thanks for taking the time to come by and see us.

As a follow-up to the show, I wanted to point you at several resources designed to dive deeper into the ways VMTurbo will dramatically improve how you control and automate your virtual data center.


 - Our Trial Download &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/cloud-edition-download.html?source=email&gt;  gives you a fully-featured, unlimited version of our Operations Manager product, FREE for 30-days. The virtual appliance is easily downloaded and configured – and will be providing value in less than 30 minutes.
 - Our online Evaluation Resource Center &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/eval-tutorials?source=Email&gt;  is designed to give you all the best practices, educational videos and one-click access to experts who can assist you in getting maximum value from your trial download.
