    <subject>Turbonomic Release 5.7 is Now Available</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
We are happy to announce that Turbonomic release 5.7 is generally available. You can now perform an online or offline update, just follow the instructions in the Green Circle Community.


	- How to Perform an Operations Manager &quot;Online Update&quot; &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-1561-how-to-perform-a-vmturbo-online-update]]&gt;
	- How to Perform an Operations Manager &quot;Offline Update&quot; &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-1292-how-to-perform-an-operations-manager-offline-update-latest-links-included]]&gt;


As with all releases, Turbonomic 5.7 adds more proof points for autonomic IT in your virtualized and cloud environments.
WHAT’S NEW


	- User Experience Improvements: In close collaboration with our large-scale enterprise customers, Turbonomic 5.7 delivers accelerated control for large-scale environments through integration with Cisco UCS Central, as well as Raw Device Mapping (RDM) files.
	- Accelerate Your Adoption of Open Source: Extend control for KVM with RHEV oVirt 4.0 support and full support for OpenStack Mitaka. With Turbonomic enterprises can accelerate their transition to open source virtualization and private cloud. The autonomic platform ensures workloads get the resources they need to perform, significantly reducing the operational investment open source typically requires.
	- Improved Resource Deployment Process: Improved accuracy and speed for initial deployment decisions and resource reservations enabling customers to intelligently match workload demand to compute and storage resources and reserve capacity for upcoming projects.
	- Extended Coverage for Software Defined Storage: Integration with VSAN and EMC ScaleIO increases coverage for storage-aware workload placement, sizing and provisioning decisions, assuring IOPS-intensive workloads are continuously matched with the right storage tier while making best use of the underlying storage environment.
	- Migration from openSUSE to CentOS: Turbonomic has traditionally shipped as a pre-configured virtual machine image, which ran the openSUSE distribution of Linux. Starting with release 5.7, Turbonomic has begun the process to base future releases on CentOS, the most widely used Linux distribution among enterprises today. By migrating to CentOS you benefit from mainstream Linux enterprise development, where patches – particularly security patches – are most quickly available. Learn more about what this means for you here. &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-4276-retirement-of-opensuse-support]]&gt;


In the coming weeks, we’ll be hosting a webinar to discuss the new features in greater depth. Keep an eye out for those registration emails. In the meantime, you can get started right away by updating your Turbonomic instances online &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-1561-how-to-perform-a-vmturbo-online-update]]&gt; or offline &lt;[[https://greencircle.vmturbo.com/docs/DOC-1292-how-to-perform-an-operations-manager-offline-update-latest-links-included]]&gt;.
