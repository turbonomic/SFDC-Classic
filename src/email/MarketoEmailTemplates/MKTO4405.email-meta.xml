Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


It&apos;s been a while since you downloaded our free Virtual Health Monitor, so I thought you might like to see what&apos;s new and try our full product free for 30 days &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/downloads/turbonomic-30-day-trial/?utm_campaign=70157000001j4jIAAQ]]&gt;.

With Turbonomic, you can do more than just monitoring. You can manage the complexity of hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure that is beyond human scale, including:



	- Understand workload interdependencies from apps to infrastructure, workload consumption, and cost in real-time
	- Automate placement, sizing, and provisioning decisions for 24/7 continuous health
	- Quickly simulate changes to find out what to buy or which cloud to migrate to


I know how vital saving time is to you and I hope that by letting the trial do the mathematical gruntwork, you can get back to improving internal processes, innovating new services, getting a new certification, or taking the vacation you deserve.
