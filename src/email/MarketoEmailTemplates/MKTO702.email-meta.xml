Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

In between networking, swag collecting, and lab and session hopping, we hope you’ll stop by VMTurbo’s booth #219  at the Microsoft Management Summit Solutions Expo. Why? Well, the tease is that we’re raffling off an Xbox 360/Kinect bundle. However, we think that a short demo of our control system for virtualized and cloud infrastructure is the bigger payoff since it assures applications get the resources they need while utilizing virtual infrastructure resources as efficiently as possible. So, make sure you stop by booth #219 for a demo—and an entry in our raffle!


Not going to MMS?  There’s still a chance to win! Connect with us via social media and you’ll be entered in a drawing for an Xbox 360 Kinect—one raffle entry for each action:

Whether you make it to Vegas or not, check out this less-than-three-minute video  &lt;http://bit.ly/10d5qId&gt;, or download a  30-day trial  &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt;.  What you will learn is that our control system focuses on maintaining your virtual data center in a perpetually healthy state rather than waiting for anomalies to occur, reacting to alarms, and forcing you into trouble-shooting mode. We automate decision-making and the recommended  actions to continuously tune workload allocations and resource configurations. In short, we save you time, money, and a lot of aggravation, while reducing the risk of service delivery disruption.

Want to see how? Stop by booth #219 at MMS or schedule a remote demo &lt;http://bit.ly/145VraT&gt;.
