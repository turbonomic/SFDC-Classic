I just wanted to follow up on the email below and see if there is any interest in jumping on a call with my engineer and I to show you exactly why companies like BMC, HP and most recently Cerner have chosen to use Turbonomic within their internal data centers.  Below is a video where the BMC CIO, Scott Crowder and his team explain the value that he sees in Turbonomic after implementing the platform into their internal infrastructure.  With Turbonomic, they were able to increase the capacity of their infrastructure by 25% while “performance went through the roof”.  Cloud Economics with BMC | A Turbonomic Success Story &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jE5YdMHJKVxQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhcAk%2DhTzTtlKmUf4xCfLFh%5FNdo66m2lmMKp5uXm1iRWQkLWGV%2DZVuwXYpwghXJKalxUwi3zlKTGJ0nxCo%5Fo60G8Z6gTYSdql6620%5Fo2wCUGGVUsPjJ00iSKKxzoeRQtnh20UkKStmjzS%5FukYUomHUC%2DNkltBU%5F79J4DZpuxymQXHazvY71afxUepinlLD%2Dr8R7NkoGo7d%5FeGP7P1m%2DVp6ZTg9kyEHVgjMQH2pXKz8DOOR%5Ftjmim25gVMk7QhiekStxkXkj4qRT96qothamPH%5FrCHXzoh2N0QuIA9A7kUbDmNIV4hDgCw7vyMFza3L0BPPsjlS0YcnUvnIVE6EPG4Y%2C/j01QeM3JL1lNoVdlsbPWNrz%5FnTrOdZWhuPJ%2DBvqpwMot1l1scencd1fmjNZeD90xaeaLBU8VEJ9vzwFRGfPYc44N6udYBgy9SnbwhqeXeIRaeflnydNj8Kaq1WkG59%2DPkROTBEQaf2Vjb1vPcYoBrwftE5UvVzuX9lmUcNUBmSE6h5EKxZmxd5W113rlp2bV%5FT3WE0Nz6JKYwGmvFbBfvP4As3QjrQMCOLPS]]&gt; Do you have 30 minutes over the next couple of weeks for my team and I to provide the introduction?

Subject: Conversation follow up - Turbonomic overview  Hi Jeff, Sorry for calling when you were waiting for Citirx to give you a call. There was a miscommunication about what Turbonomic can do for you and the team at All Children’s Hospital.  We are a virtualization control platform that uses a demand driven approach to allow for our customers to increase application performance while increasing the efficiency of their infrastructure. This allows our customers to spend less money on hardware year over year and eliminates the need for alerting and ticketing tools (i.e. Solarwinds, VRops) as Turbonomic uses automation around every layer of the infrastructure to keep it in a healthy state.  Mary Washington Healthcare Saves $180,000 with Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-MaryWashingtonHealth-Success-Story.pdf]]&gt;  Do you have fifteen to thirty minutes for one of my engineers and I to introduce the platform to you to see if we could provide the same benefits?    Best regards, James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;   Going to Cisco Live?
