    <subject>Your Free Trial of Operations Manager</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We’re writing to check in and see if you have any questions about your trial of Operations Manager and how it’s performing a continuous real-time health check for your virtualized data center. 

As you’re already experiencing, rather than troubleshooting issues, it’s much more efficient to maintain your systems and applications in a healthy state, thus preventing problems from igniting in the first place. The automated decision-making engine in Operations Manager keeps up with all the fluctuations in your environment and enables you to maintain the right balance of performance while driving optimal utilization across your infrastructure. 

Got just a few minutes? Check this out &lt;http://bit.ly/ZryjPI&gt; to learn how VMTurbo uses prescriptive analytics to derive the right actions that maintain this desired state and why Forrester Research contends 
that IT analytics is essential for combatting the complexity brought about by virtualization .

Let’s schedule a short call &lt;http://bit.ly/11ak6XJ&gt; so that we can discuss how you can continue to automate your data center operations 
and maintain control over your environment.

Thank you,

VMTurbo Team
