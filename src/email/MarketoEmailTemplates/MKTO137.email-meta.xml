    <subject>VMTurbo Trial: What did you think?</subject>
    <textOnly>   


Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},


I hope you had a positive experience with your trial download of VMTurbo Operations Manager. If you would like to download &lt;http://go.vmturbo.com/new-community-edition-license.html&gt; our Community Edition you can benefit from its monitoring and reporting features.

I’d love to get your feedback on your experience with our trial. You can take our eight-question (no kidding) survey &lt;http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/63NJJZD&gt; in a minute or two (really, no kidding). Let us know what we do well and where we need improvement. Don’t hold back. We welcome your comments and suggestions.

And, if you’re missing the rich features of the Enterprise or Cloud Edition, let’s discuss putting a quote together!

Thank you!
