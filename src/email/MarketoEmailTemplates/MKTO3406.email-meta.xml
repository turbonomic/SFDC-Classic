    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},



On Thursday, January 18th, the green at TPC Sawgrass will be frequented by your technology peers for an afternoon of food, drinks, and of course, golf, with Turbonomic and Cisco while we take on the Dye Valley Course. 
Whether you are customer today or still considering becoming a part of the family, I hope you will join me for this fun event to get to know our community.
