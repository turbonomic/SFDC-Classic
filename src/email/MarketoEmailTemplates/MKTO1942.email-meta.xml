Hi {{Lead.First Name}},
Organizations are moving towards OpenStack cloud for the promise of no vendor lock-in, IT agility, and competitive differentiation. This movement is part of a larger shift away from rigid, heavy IT to demanding technologies that enable them to build exactly what they want, when they want it.

Turbonomic&apos;s Autonomic Platform seamlessly integrates with OpenStack to keep the cloud environment in its Desired State—continuously assuring application performance, while maximizing infrastructure utilization.
