Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for attending our webcast on June 18th and for joining the discussion about how the latest release of VMTurbo Operations Manager improves performance and reduces infrastructure cost across the virtual datacenter through software-defined control.

If you were not able to attend the entire session or would like to revisit parts of it, you can watch it here &lt;http://www.vmturbo.com/operations-manager-webcast-thank-you/&gt;. If you have any questions that arise as you view it, please let us know.

We look forward to following up with you to discuss further how software-defined control can improve your virtual datacenter operations. 


Sincerely,

The VMTurbo Team</textOnly>
