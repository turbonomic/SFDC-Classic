    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-cloud-status-quo/?utm_campaign=70157000001j57eAAA]]&gt;
For decades, on-premises IT has operated under a model where things break, and once again IT is left to engineer. This break-fix loop has extended into the cloud as workloads are migrated, budgets are overrun, and then IT is left to engineer cost reduction plans.

Meanwhile, scalability, agility, and operational efficiency suffer as costs rise. This vicious cycle is called the cloud status quo.
 
Join Mor Cohen, CTO of Cloud at Turbonomic on January 23, 2019, at 11 am for our “How to Beat the Cloud Status Quo &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/resources/wbn-cloud-status-quo/?utm_campaign=70157000001j57eAAA]]&gt;” webinar to find out how to overcome this break-fix loop. During this 30 minute session you will learn:


	- How organizations are negatively impacted by the cloud cost break-fix loop

	- The key factors that collectively drive cost optimization in the cloud

	- How to quantifiably improve performance and reduce costs in the cloud
