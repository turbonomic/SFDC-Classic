By now, you should have received your $25 Amazon Gift Card via email. I am reaching out again because I wanted to follow up on my previous note; based upon your answers to our survey, I believe Turbonomic could provide tremendous value to your organization, and I’d like to show you why.   Furthermore, we are offering a $100 gift card or a $100 donation to a charity of your choice, in your name, if you choose to engage in a 30-minute consultation with us to learn about Turbonomic. However, in order to receive this gift card or have the donation made, you must schedule this meeting before the end of next week (May 26th) and complete it before June 16th (you will receive the second gift card via email within 48 hours of meeting completion). Are you available over the next couple of days for a 30 minute intro? If you agree to engage in a proof of value with us after this initial introduction, we are also offering to make an additional $1,000 donation in your name to a charity of your choice. Best, James From: James Wilcox
