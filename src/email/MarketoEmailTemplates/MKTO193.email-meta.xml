Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We know you’re busy, so we’ll be brief.

We get that your time is limited. That’s one of the reasons why we believe that IT operations management for virtual and cloud environments needs to be fundamentally changed: to allow you to unlock the full value of virtualized infrastructure and cloud services without spending unnecessary time reacting to performance 
issues. Our charter is to transform IT operations in cloud and virtualized environments from a complex, labor intensive, and volatile process to one that is simple, automated and predictable – delivering greater control in maintaining a healthy state and consistent service delivery. 

VMTurbo delivers a control system for virtual infrastructure that ensures performance and reduces both capital and operational costs of running virtual data centers. And it frees you from monitoring and analyzing thousand of data points about your environment, and being reactive when one of them violates a threshold.

Learn more &lt;http://bit.ly/10cctnM&gt; about how we can help you control and automate your virtual data center and free up your time for the other critical aspects of your job. Download a trial &lt;http://bit.ly/QzvQgM&gt; today.

Best regards,

The VMTurbo Team
