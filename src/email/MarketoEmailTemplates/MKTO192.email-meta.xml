    <subject>Modern Infrastructure Decisions: To Your Virtual Health</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Are you open for a follow up meeting to discuss key takeaways from the Modern Infrastructure event last week?

As our founder, Shmuel Kliger, outlined during his talk, VMTurbo reduces the costs and risks associated with virtualization / cloud initiatives by delivering a different approach &lt;http://bit.ly/10cctnM&gt; to managing virtualized IT. Our philosophy is focused on achieving software-defined control to maintain the environment in an optimal state â€“think of it like a virtual health check--so that you can experience fewer incidents, achieve higher density, and deliver projects in less time and with better certainty of 
performance and efficiency.  You can check out this paper &lt;http://bit.ly/Z19QCA&gt; for more detail.

Again please let me know when you are available for a quick discussion about how our fundamentally better approach to IT Operations will enable you to achieve your business and operational goals. 

To Your Virtual Health,

Yotam Yemini
