Join Jonathan Reeve, Director of Product Marketing at VMTurbo for a webinar on August 6th at 11:00 AM EDT and learn how to address the need to manage resource contention in the storage layer while maintaining the virtual environment in the desired state, delivering application performance and efficiency.

Jonathan will highlight examples and use cases of how companies like yours can:


 - Reduce ongoing storage infrastructure costs by 20-30%
 - Prevent complex storage problems before they impact workloads
 - Ensure application performance and reduce risk 
 - Drive down the cost of delivering compute services to your business and customers
