Your enterprise runs on applications. They are at the core for processing transactions, analyzing reams of data or delighting consumers. Like most organizations you probably have a virtualization first policy for mission critical applications and are pursuing deployment models that leverage both private infrastructure and public cloud resources. But unless you take care of performance you won’t get much sleep at night.
In this webinar we will discuss common challenges enterprises face today with performance of their application as they scale and transform. We will review data from over 1,000 organizations around the challenges they face, as well as, customer success stories and a demo of VMTurbo’s platform running on-prem or in the Azure cloud.
Use cases and customer success stories will include:


 - One system across private and public infrastructure for real-time performance assurance (30% app performance improvement)
 - Moving workloads from any infrastructure (e.g. VMware) to Azure public cloud to assure performance
 - Optimal use of available resources (30-50% increase in utilization) and reduce hardware spend by 30%-50%
 - Accelerating the migration from a VMware to Microsoft centric infrastructure while improving performance and reducing costs
