    <subject>What Is The Bane Of The Software Defined Universe?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{Lead.First Name}},



We are entering a very exciting and progressive time. It seems we are moving away from hardware to a fully software defined universe, opening the door for new levels of innovation. With this change however, comes a large growing pain, namely software defined latency.

In this blog post our founder Shmuel Kliger addresses this growing pain, including how we can confront the feeling that &quot;IT is in chaos.&quot;
