Former CIO of GE Just Led a $50M Bet on Turbonomic 

We are pleased to share an exciting piece of news regarding Turbonomic&apos;s growth. On Monday morning, Turbonomic announced &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/press-releases/former-ge-cio-gary-reiner-joins-turbonomic-board/]]&gt; that it has secured $50 million in additional funding, led by General Atlantic, a leading global growth equity investment firm, as well as the addition of Gary Reiner &lt;[[http://www.generalatlantic.com/people/gary-reiner/]]&gt;, former CIO of GE and current Operating Partner at General Atlantic, to the company&apos;s Board of Directors. 

Mr. Reiner, who says Turbonomic is &quot;on the right side of history,&quot; brings with him a deep understanding of the challenges faced by CIOs in assuring application performance and maintaining a competitive advantage through implementing innovating IT strategies. Turbonomic plans to invest a significant portion of this funding in product development, particularly around hybrid and public cloud management capabilities.
Both the fundraising and growth of Turbonomic&apos;s Board were profiled in Forbes &lt;[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2017/01/23/turbonomic-raises-50-mil-from-general-atlantic/#535571ea6755]]&gt; as one of &quot;Today&apos;s Top Stories&quot; on Monday.
