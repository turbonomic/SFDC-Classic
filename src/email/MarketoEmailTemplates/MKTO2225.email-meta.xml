If after the call it is not a fit for the moment, I promise to respect your time and walk away. Garland, Texas Saves More Than $200,000 with Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/wp-content/uploads/Turbonomic-CityGarland-Success-Story.pdf]]&gt; (not a Florida use case but I thought you’d find it interesting) Cedar, how does your calendar look over the next few weeks for an initial call? Best regards, James  From: James Wilcox

Subject: Referral from Barrett Langston - Turbonomic  Cedar – After speaking with Barrett Langston I wanted to reach out to see if you had some time over the next couple of weeks to discuss why other Florida countie public schools like Orange County Public School, Seminole County Public Schools have invested in our software to enable the infrastructure teams to increase application performance while increasing efficiency within their infrastructure.  Seminole County Public Schools: &lt;[[http://info.turbonomic.com/ol/jEtWdsbOI1xQsRpg5uiMMKvivTDUe5u9qKgwWbq2n59ziQVuYOPLdRGphcBWFZZvNa%2DaCAZNQsIylEpLFL3FOoVJ%5FqhRDkK6Vj7tlIHKbJ5MP7th24d09qz4iCYAssmQkwHhPWIXRllCfT%5FPZbQQsBS1HYonBwGw3GvDEosorBwMjJAO58eFSYaj10eO%5FGqUxSGgE2QtyeLK4nGICJNGr%5F0IhUwe438SerPYsRyU7591sAgx2L9xqiZ29K4iechlxgezZgn24N30XNE8G%2DGDuNCjv%5FADeRw60pEvTEPEEAnqG4ywV3NI%5FBzVoxAWBQpnBAReIcUmljezs3ptWuw7YTi8miABzG0s5K9v9r%5FhiCLIfXq4bjDHtk32lknmbw%2C%2C/j0FVcsLGLllNoVdlsbPWJbvomjvDc4qrt7kzH%5Fryx9081gZ9feGAPVn7jcFfHZ5%5FaeCQCkwaAIBgnxlKFr2daJRQ6bAOKgTgfn6tprXPfY9Bf7t%2D1cIv%5FKeonTIjvc3PkVPCHUoAVDQ%2DQhONZbAhgC6iYrYXShGF9XXOOI4g0RsrtY5J5Yeofran6D6T4UvU9XueMFc76cqP1UizB8Q4g%2DIglHsuy1R3T%2DHg1jndh%2D4HrC9u2P1lyE5N%2DMRkEMhCpUGvfXTn3bfBGrpDV56EpfHrlcgORh87voJrKEqUen8%2C]]&gt; With Turbonomic’s real-time capacity management to simulate a migration from old Dell hosts to new Cisco UCS blades, the team learned they could consolidate from 12 hosts down to 3, enabling them to save nearly $80,000. These funds can now be reallocated to new projects focused on innovation, such as collapsing and centralizing much of their remote site infrastructure to enable more unified IT management.  I was hoping that you might have 30 minutes for an introduction to the platform to see if we could provide the same value that the other Florida counties/public schools have seen from Turbonomic. With the large investment the team has made in VMware and Citrix XenServer I think there would be many great use cases to cover. Do you have 30 minutes for an introduction next week?  Best,  James Wilcox  Turbonomic &lt;[[https://turbonomic.com/product/#lower-infrastructure-costs]]&gt;C: (508) 479 7516 Email: james.wilcox@turbonomic.com &lt;[[mailto:james.wilcox@turbonomic.com]]&gt;  Going to Cisco Live?
