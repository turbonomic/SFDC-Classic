<p>Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=}},<br /><br />I realize it has been a few months since we last connected but I wanted to invite you, along with your CSC peers to join the <a 
href="http://t.sidekickopen03.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgcW5jlW7gbZWP2m4qM8F42Qjy2mMVmdwVQb003?t=https%3a%2f%2fgreencircle.vmturbo.com%2fwelcome&amp;si=6003933757571072&amp;pi=2ccc9752-ed7f-4778-b73a-b9e2790b235c">Green Circle Community</a>.
 You might remember the group from our booth at TechCom - it's designed as a peer-to-peer online community of &nbsp;innovators, virtualization experts and forward-thinking IT pros.
 Members engage with other customers and VMTurbo engineers and have an active dialogue about product ideas and other questions.
 It is a site where you can find case studies, best practices, industry perspectives, product discussions and lots more.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, we've been working on creating a forum within the community that is dedicated to CSC and I'm excited to say that it's finally ready.
 Relevant content with specific use cases and best practices will be posted by both CSC and VMTurbo team members.
 Sign up <a href="http://t.sidekickopen03.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgcW5jlW7gbZWP2m4qM8F42Qjy2mMVmdwVQb003?t=https%3a%2f%2fgreencircle.vmturbo.com%2fgroups%2fcsc-group%2foverview&amp;si=6003933757571072&amp;pi=2ccc9752-ed7f-4778-b73a-b9e2790b235c">here</a>, and be sure to 
visit often as content will be updated regularly.
 Keep in mind the Green Circle Community is open to all VMTurbo customers and you can go there to post general questions and get feedback from existing users.
 The CSC forum is a private space for materials and discussions better shared with CSC peers only.
 I encourage you to share your thoughts and feedback on VMTurbo and if you do you will earn points which you can redeem for VMTurbo merchandise.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing the conversation in the forum and hearing your thoughts.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Justin Kutticherry</p>
