    <subject>Your Invitation to Chill: VIP Cocktail Reception with VMTurbo Following VMWorld</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},
 
We’re excited that you will be joining us for the VIP Cocktail Reception on Monday, July 26, 2013, 6PM at 25 
Lusk in San Francisco.  It ‘s the perfect location for relaxation after the hustle and bustle of VMWorld.
 
Don’t forget to cruise by booth #611 and try our surf simulator, enter to win 
your own trip to paradise, and find out more about how to achieve datacenter control.
 
In the meantime, to quench your thirst for information about how VMTurbo can optimize your virtualized environment 
across VMWare and multiple hypervisors, check out this white paper &lt;http://bit.ly/18wIHtR&gt;.
 
Cheers,
VMTurbo Team
