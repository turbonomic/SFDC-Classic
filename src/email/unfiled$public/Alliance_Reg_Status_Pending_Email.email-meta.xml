The Turbonomic registration that you submitted has been reviewed by the Turbo Alliances team. We are now working to set up a meeting with your respective counterparts on the account:
 
Account Name: {!Alliance_Registration__c.Customer_Account_Name__c}
Opportunity Description: {!Alliance_Registration__c.Project_Opportunity_Description__c}
 
Turbo Manager: {!Alliance_Registration__c.Sales_Manager__c}
Turbo Rep: {!Alliance_Registration__c.Sales_Rep__c}
 
You should expect a meeting invite within the week to review the opportunity in greater detail, so we can discuss next steps and either approve or deny the registration.
 
Looking forward to speaking with you soon.
 
Regards,
The Turbo Team</textOnly>
