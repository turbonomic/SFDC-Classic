Our customers are able to ensure that applications get the computer and storage resources they need to operate reliably, while continuously utilizing their infrastructure and human resources in the most efficient way. 

I&apos;m very interested in spending a minute with you to understand what part virtualization management plays in your organization&apos;s strategy to minimize capital and operational expenses related to the data center.
