<![CDATA[<P>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},</P>
<P><BR>I wanted to reach out to you and introduce myself and VMTurbo. I know you are very busy, so rather than comb through our website, I thought a good place to start would be with the information in this email. The first is a blog post in PDF format that hit the wire a few weeks ago by our founder, Shmuel Kliger. Shmuel was formerly the CTO at EMC and decades ago wrote the paper that defined the term “root cause analysis.” <BR><BR>The second is this video that is a good introduction in under two minutes; <A href="http://www.vmturbo.com/vmtvideo" target=_blank><FONT color=#000000>http://www.vmturbo.com/vmtvideo</FONT></A> <BR><BR>Please reach out to me if you get a minute to connect, otherwise I will make a note to follow up later in the week. <BR><BR>Best, <BR><BR>Ray <BR></P>]]></td>
