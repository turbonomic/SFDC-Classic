    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName}, 
 
I&apos;m trying to connect with you for a quick second. I work at VMTurbo, a software company focused on proactive resource management for virtualized data centers. VMTurbo provides guided operational support by analyzing workload demands and resource capacities. The result of our real-time analytics is that workloads get the resources they need while maximizing the utilization of servers and storage. Our technology has been developed by a team of PhD&apos;s with over 100+ combined years of IT experience. 

I&apos;d really appreciate a moment of your time to understand your organization&apos;s financial and technical strategies regarding data center virtualization and explore with you whether VMTurbo could be a potential fit. 

Best regards,
