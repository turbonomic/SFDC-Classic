    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

Given your role in managing a virtualized environment in a Higher Education institution, I wanted to share with you a virtualization management approach other universities have chosen to assure application performance AND maximize infrastructure efficiency.

Of particular interest may be some of the examples attached that highlight the successes of the largest universities using VMTurbo. I donâ€™t know if we are in a position to help you in the same way that we have at London School of Economics, Indiana University and others, but I would certainly welcome the opportunity for a brief discussion to better understand your virtualization goals.

I know this is a busy time of year for you, and I promise to keep the conversation brief. I will follow up with you within the next couple of days.

Sincerely,
{!Lead.OwnerFirstName} {!Lead.OwnerLastName}
