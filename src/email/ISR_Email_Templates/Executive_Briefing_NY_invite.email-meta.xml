Executive Session: Practical Considerations for Cloud Architectures

VMTurbo is sponsoring an informal dialog about cloud in the enterprise, and we’d like to add your voice.

Thursday, February 20
5:30 PM-7:30 PM
230 Fifth Bar | 230 5th Ave @ 27th St, New York

RSVP Today &lt;http://bit.ly/1hkhpeh&gt;

Enterprises are adopting elements of the software defined datacenter to improve agility and contain costs as they move toward private, public, and hybrid cloud architectures.

Columbia professor Yechiam Yemini – whose expertise is in distributed systems – will be hosting a session on practical considerations for cloud architectures.

We’ll also be raffling an Xbox One and a PlayStation 4. Space is limited, so please RSVP &lt;http://bit.ly/1hkhpeh&gt; today.

Sincerely,
VMTurbo</textOnly>
